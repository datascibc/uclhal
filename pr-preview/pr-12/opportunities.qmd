## For Undergraduate Students
The lab is frequently home to undergraduate students ... 

<!-- Undergraduate students work as **research assistants**, learning about the scientific method and assisting in the collection and processing of research data. Many enroll in PSYC 480 and receive **credit hours** for this work. Research assistants attend weekly lab meetings and can expect a **letter of recommendation** from **** describing their work in and contributions to the lab (please give one month of advanced notice). Opportunities to earn **co-authorship** on research products (e.g., conference presentations) are also occasionally offered to advanced research assistants. -->
