## Biography

I am a graduate entry medical student in RCSI Dublin, Ireland. Before studying medicine I worked as a software engineer for Microsoft, completed an MSc Artificial Intelligence for Medicine & Medical Research and BSc Computer Science from University College Dublin. I am interested in translational research using electronic health records and critical care. Currently, I am working with other members of the lab to model 'ward strain' and how it relates to patient deterioration.
