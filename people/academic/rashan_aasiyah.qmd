## Biography

I am a data scientist undertaking a PhD at the [UKRI UCL Centre for Doctoral Training in AI-enabled Healthcare Systems](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/aihealth-cdt/). I am also a data analyst at [CritCare Asia Africa](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03321-7)

My PhD focuses on establishing a harmonised [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) dataset with an [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) common data model for CritCare Asia Africa and then assessing the usability of that dataset by combining CritCare Asia Africa and UK critical care data to look at the timing of tracheostomies in ICU patients. My specific methods focus is on (a) causal inference and (b) reproducibility of biological findings across health care systems.
