## Biography

I am an academic Anaesthetic and Critical Care doctor, and a Wellcome Trust 4i Clinical PhD Fellow at Imperial College London.

My research focuses on early diagnosis and improved treatment of critical illness, using methods from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in merging these methods with physiological models to provide bedside decision support, in disease heterogeneity, and in the role of uncertainty in clinical decision-making.

My recent work includes:

- [Uncertainty-aware mortality risk prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00616-7) for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Our prediction model is available as a [web app and API](https://laparotomy-risk.com/).
- [Representing patientsâ€™ status using time-series data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31858114/) to better anticipate clinical deterioration in the Intensive Care Unit.
- Exploiting structure in medical knowledge to [improve rare disease recognition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30409346/) during automated clinical coding.
- An open-source software library (in Python) for [preprocessing and analysis of physiological waveforms](https://pypi.org/project/medical-waveforms/).
