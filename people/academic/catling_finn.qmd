## Biography

I am an academic Anaesthetic and Critical Care doctor, and a Wellcome Trust 4i Clinical PhD Fellow at Imperial College London.

My research aims at early diagnosis and improved treatment of critical illness, using methods from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in merging these methods with physiological models to provide bedside decision support, in disease heterogeneity, and in the role of uncertainty in clinical decision-making.

My recent work includes uncertainty-aware mortality risk prediction for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, representing ICU patientsâ€™ status using time-series data to predict clinical events, using structured knowledge for automated clinical coding and phenotyping ventilator-associated pneumonia in electronic health records.
