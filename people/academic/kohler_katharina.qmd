## Biography

I am an NIHR Research DSE Fellow working within the wider UCL Health Algorithms group. I am interested in peri-operative health systems both within the UK and a global health setting. My position as Locum Consultant in Anaesthesia at Cambridge University Hospitals gives me the clinical background to inform my research.

Combining technical expertise in data science from my previous experience in physics research with my background in peri-operative medicine I am keen to discover the how aspects of health systems affect patient care quality and outcomes. I am particularly interested in analysing healthcare systems and resource usage both within the high-income data-rich environment of electronic health records and the low-income data-poor setting of low- and middle income (LMIC) acute care services. Within the data science setting I hope to employ quantitative methods from other areas of data science such as network analysis, machine learning and simulation to develop clinically founded models that allow us to understand strain/stress within healthcare systems and effectively target improvement and development in the peri-operative care.


Some of my recent work published in a variety of journals:
