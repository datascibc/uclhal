Doctoral Research Student
-------------------------

.. class:: col-md-5

I am an academic Anaesthetic and Critical Care doctor, and a Wellcome Trust 4i Clinical PhD Fellow at Imperial College London.

My research aims at early diagnosis and improved treatment of critical illness, using methods from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. I am particularly interested in merging these methods with physiological models to provide bedside decision support, in disease heterogeneity, and in the role of uncertainty in clinical decision-making.

My recent work includes representing ICU patientsâ€™ status using time-series data to allow prediction of clinical events, exploiting structured knowledge for automated clinical coding, mortality risk prediction for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, and phenotyping of ventilator-associated pneumonia in electronic health records.

I am an NHS England Clinical Entrepreneurship Fellow, a fellow of the Faculty of Clinical Informatics and a member of the core advisory group for the Academic Health Science Networks Artificial Intelligence Programme. I co-founded and lecture on the Data Science for Doctors courses, and previously co-founded the medical education startup T-Log.
