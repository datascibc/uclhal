**LEGACY: No longer maintained**

The security put in place to ensure the safety of this resource inevitably creates challenges for the researchers. We have therefore created a three sided tool to make CCHIC research ready.

- this shared code library
- an anonymised development data set
- a virtual machine for simulating work within the safe haven
