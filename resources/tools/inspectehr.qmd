`inspectEHR` is a quality evaluation tool for CC-HIC. The goal of this package is to provide a core set of functions to detect erroneous or otherwise questionable data within CC-HIC, so that the end researcher can handle this information explicitly.

The design ethos of inspectEHR is to apply a comprehensive interpretation of the Khan data quality evaluation framework.

The full default evaluation is largely automated, and can be performed by use of the perform_evaluation() function. The output from this function is stored in the CC-HIC database as metadata, so that downstream research can use a consistent set of rules when faced with erroneous data patterns.

Helper functions for extracting and wrangling data have also been developed. These live in the sister package wranglEHR, which must be installed for inspectEHR to function correctly.
