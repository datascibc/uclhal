    Background. The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is associated strongly
    with increased cardiac ischaemic risk and perioperative death. Associations
    with non-cardiac morbidity in non-cardiac surgery have not been explored. In
    the elective orthopaedic surgical population, morbidity is common but
    preoperative predictors are unclear. We hypothesized that RCRI would
    identify individuals at increased risk of non-cardiac morbidity in this
    surgically homogenous population.

    Methods. Five hundred and sixty patients undergoing elective primary (.90%)
    and revision hip and knee procedures were studied. A modiﬁed RCRI (mRCRI)
    score was calculated, weighting intermediate and low risk factors. The
    primary endpoint was the development of morbidity, collected prospectively
    using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey, on postoperative day (POD) 5.

    Results. Morbidity on POD 5 was more frequent in patients with mRCRI ≥3
    {relative risk 1.7, [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.4–2.1]; P,0.001}. Time
    to hospital discharge was delayed in patients with mRCRI score ≥3 (log-rank
    test, P¼0.0002). Pulmonary (P,0.001), infectious (P¼0.001), cardiovascular
    (P¼0.0003), renal (P,0.0001), wound (P¼0.02), and neurological (P¼0.002)
    morbidities were more common in patients with mRCRI score ≥3. Pre/
    postoperative haematocrit, anaesthetic/analgesic technique, and
    postoperative temperature were similar across mRCRI groups. There were
    signiﬁcant associations with hospital stay, as measured by the area under
    the receiver-operating characteristic curves for mRCRI 0.64 (95% CI:
    0.58–0.70) and POSSUM 0.70 (95% CI: 0.63–0.75).

    Conclusions. mRCRI score ≥3 is associated with increased postoperative
    non-cardiac morbidity and prolonged hospital stay after elective orthopaedic
    procedures. mRCRI can contribute to objective risk stratiﬁcation of
    postoperative morbidity.

    Delirium, an acute confusional state, is a common occurrence in Intensive
    Care Units (ICUs). Patients who develop delirium have globally worse
    outcomes than those who do not and thus the diagnosis of delirium is of
    importance. Current diagnostic methods have several limitations leading to
    the suggestion of eye-tracking for its diagnosis through in-attention. To
    ascertain the requirements for an eye-tracking system in an adult ICU,
    measurements were carried out at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS
    Foundation Trust. Clinical criteria guided empirical requirements of
    invasiveness and calibration methods while accuracy and precision were
    measured. A non-invasive system was then developed utilising a
    patient-facing RGB camera and a scene-facing RGBD camera. The system’s
    performance was measured in a replicated laboratory environment with healthy
    volunteers revealing an accuracy and precision that outperforms what is
    required while simultaneously being non-invasive and calibration-free The
    system was then deployed as part of CONfuSED, a clinical feasibility study
    where we report aggregated data from 5 patients as well as the acceptability
    of the system to bedside nursing staff. To the best of our knowledge, the
    system is the first eye-tracking systems to be deployed in an ICU for
    delirium monitoring.

  abstract: >-
    Blinking is a useful biological signal that can gate gaze regression models
    to avoid the use of incorrect data in downstream tasks. Existing datasets
    are imbalanced both in frequency of class but also in intra-class difficulty
    which we demonstrate is a barrier for curriculum learning. We thus propose a
    novel curriculum augmentation scheme that aims to address frequency and
    difficulty imbalances implicitly which are are terming Curriculum Learning
    by Augmentation (CLbA). Using Curriculum Learning by Augmentation (CLbA), we
    achieve a state-of-the-art performance of mean Average Precision (mAP) 0.971
    using ResNet-18 up from the previous state-of-the-art of mean Average
    Precision (mAP) of 0.757 using DenseNet-121 whilst outcompeting Curriculum
    Learning by Bootstrapping (CLbB) by a significant margin with improved
    calibration. This new training scheme thus allows the use of smaller and
    more performant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones fulfilling
    Nyquist criteria to achieve a sampling frequency of 102.3Hz. This paves the
    way for inference of blinking in real-time applications.

    Locating the user’s gaze in the scene, also known as Point of Regard (PoR)
    estimation, following gaze regression is important for many downstream
    tasks. Current techniques either require the user to wear and calibrate
    instruments, require significant pre-processing of the scene information, or
    place restrictions on user’s head movements.We propose a geometrically
    inspired algorithm that, despite its simplicity, provides high accuracy and
    O(J) performance under a variety of challenging situations including sparse
    depth maps, high noise, and high dynamic parallax between the user and the
    scene camera. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in
    regressing the PoR from scenes captured in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at
    Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trusta.

    Objective To compare the effectiveness of melarsoprol and eflornithine in
    treating late-stage Gambian trypanosomiasis in the Republic of the Congo.

    Methods We analysed the outcomes of death during treatment and relapse
    within 1 year of discharge for 288 patients treated with eflornithine, 311
    patients treated with the standard melarsoprol regimen and 62 patients
    treated with a short-course (10-day) melarsoprol regimen between April 2001
    and April 2005. Findings A total of 1.7% (5/288) of patients treated with
    eflornithine died compared with 4.8% (15/311) of those treated with standard
    melarsoprol and 6.5% (4/62) of those treated with short-course melarsoprol.
    Patients treated with eflornithine tended to be younger and were more likely
    to have trypanosomes or higher white blood cell counts in their
    cerebrospinal fluid. The cumulated incidence of relapse among patients who
    attended at least one follow-up visit 1 year after discharge was 8.1%
    (11/136) for those treated with eflornithine, 14% (36/258) for those treated
    with standard melarsoprol and 15.5% (9/58) for those treated with
    shortcourse melarsoprol. In a multivariate analysis, when compared with
    eflornithine, standard melarsoprol was found to be a risk factor for both
    death (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–8.00) and
    relapse (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.22–5.03); when compared with
    eflornithine, short-course melarsoprol was also found to be a risk factor
    for death (OR = 3.90; 95% CI = 1.02–14.98) and relapse (HR = 6.65; 95% CI =
    2.61–16.94).

    Conclusion The effectiveness of melarsoprol treatment appears to have
    diminished. Eflornithine seems to be a better first-line therapy for
    treating late-stage Gambian trypanosomiasis in the Republic of the Congo.

  abstract: >-
    Objective In 2002–03, the Republic of the Congo increased the threshold
    separating stage 1 and 2 cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) from a
    cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count of 5 cells/mm³ to 10 cells/mm³.
    We aimed to assess whether the increased threshold of 10 cells/mm³ is a safe
    indicator of stage 2 disease.

    Methods We assessed patients treated for stage 1 HAT caused by Trypanosoma
    brucei gambiense in the Republic of the Congo between April 2001 and April
    2005. Patients with 0–10 cells/mm³ in CSF were classed as stage 1 and
    treated with pentamidine. Patients with CSF of > 10 cells/mm³ were classed
    as stage 2 and treated with either melarsoprol or eflornithine. We did a
    retrospective analysis of all patients treated after the September 2002
    increase in threshold for classification of HAT disease stage 2, and who
    were eligible for at least 1 year of follow-up. Primary outcome was survival
    without death or relapse within 1 year of discharge. Risk factors for
    treatment failure, in particular CSF white cell count on diagnosis, were
    assessed. Findings Between September 2002 to April 2004, 692 patients
    eligible for our analysis were treated with pentamidine. All were discharged
    alive. Relapse rate was 5% (n = 33). The only identified risk factor for
    relapse was a CSF white cell count of 6–10 cells/mm³ rather than 0–5
    cells/mm³ (adjusted hazard ratio 3.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.52–7.01);
    P = 0.002).

    Conclusion A threshold of 5 white cells/mm³ in CSF is safer than 10
    cells/mm³ to determine stage 2 HAT and reduce risk of relapse. Bulletin of
    the World Health Organization 2006;84:777-782. Voir page 781 le résumé en

    Background The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus
    disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population
    mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over
    days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying
    conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions
    or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the
    excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence
    scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing
    mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.

    Background: Perioperative infection and sepsis are of fundamental concern to
    perioperative clinicians. However, standardised endpoints are either poorly
    deﬁned or not routinely implemented. The Standardised Endpoints in
    Perioperative Medicine (StEP) initiative was established to derive a set of
    standardised endpoints for use in perioperative clinical trials.

    Methods: We undertook a systematic review to identify measures of infection
    and sepsis used in the perioperative literature. A multi-round Delphi
    consensus process that included more than 60 clinician researchers was then
    used to reﬁne a recommended list of outcome measures.

    Results: A literature search yielded 1857 titles of which 255 met inclusion
    criteria for endpoint extraction. A long list of endpoints, with deﬁnitions
    and timescales, was generated and those potentially relevant to infection
    and sepsis circulated to the theme subgroup and then the wider StEP-COMPAC
    working group, undergoing a three-stage Delphi process. The response rates
    for Delphi rounds 1, 3, and 3 were 89% (n¼8), 67% (n¼62), and 80% (n¼8),
    respectively. A set of 13 endpoints including fever, surgical site, and
    organ-speciﬁc infections as deﬁned by the US Centres for Disease Control and
    Sepsis-3 are proposed for future use.

    Conclusions: We deﬁned a consensus list of standardised endpoints related to
    infection and sepsis for perioperative trials using an established and
    rigorous approach. Each endpoint was evaluated with respect to validity,
    reliability, feasibility, and patient centredness. One or more of these
    should be considered for inclusion in future perioperative clinical trials
    assessing infection, sepsis, or both, thereby permitting synthesis and
    comparison of future results.

    Abstract
                The increasing volume and richness of healthcare data collected during routine clinical practice have not yet translated into significant numbers of actionable insights that have systematically improved patient outcomes. An evidence-practice gap continues to exist in healthcare. We contest that this gap can be reduced by assessing the use of nudge theory as part of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Deploying nudges to modify clinician behaviour and improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy represents an underused tool in bridging the evidence-practice gap. In conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) and newer devices including artificial intelligence algorithms that are increasingly integrated within learning health systems, nudges such as CDSS alerts should be iteratively tested for all stakeholders involved in health decision-making: clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. Not only could they improve the implementation of known evidence, but the true value of nudging could lie in areas where traditional randomized controlled trials are lacking, and where clinical equipoise and variation dominate. The opportunity to test CDSS nudge alerts and their ability to standardize behaviour in the face of uncertainty may generate novel insights and improve patient outcomes in areas of clinical practice currently without a robust evidence base.

    Data Study Groups are week-long events at The Alan Turing Institute bringing
    together some of the country’s top talent from data science, artificial
    intelligence, and wider fields, to analyse real-world data science
    challenges. <strong>Automating perfusion assessment of sublingual
    microcirculation in critical illness</strong> Achieving and maintaining
    normal sub-lingual blood flow in small ( 20m) vessels, termed as
    microcirculation, is essential for critically ill intensive care patients
    since this is where the delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues occurs.
    However, historically, most clinical trials &amp; treatments have focused on
    blood flow in the larger blood vessels (macrocirculation) \[20, 21, 14],
    largely due to the greater ease with which this can be practically measured.
    Technological advances have enabled video recordings of the sub-lingual
    microcirculation (i.e. from under the tongue) to be obtained using darkfield
    microscopy (DFM). However, the difficulties in analysing these videos has
    hindered the uptake and utilisation of this imaging modality. Currently,
    these short video sequences are analysed mostly by hand, to quantify the
    vessel density and flow within vessels within the field of view. The manual
    analysis and vessel segmentation is an extremely labour intensive procedure,
    which can take up to one hour to score a single video \[12]. This challenge
    aimed to establish whether a single validated measure of microcirculatory
    perfusion (microcirculatory flow index) can be predicted directly from a DFM
    video sequence, without intermediate manual analysis steps. Automatic
    analysis that can be carried out in (near) real-time would facilitate the
    incorporation of microcirulatory targets into clinical trials by enabling
    the impact of interventions to be quantified and enacted upon with the aim
    of optimising the microcirculation and improving patient outcomes.

    Purpose: Septic shock is associated with massive release of endogenous
    catecholamines. Adrenergic agents may exacerbate catecholamine toxicity and
    contribute to poor outcomes. We sought to determine whether an association
    existed between tachycardia and mortality in septic shock patients requiring
    norepinephrine for more than 6 h despite adequate volume resuscitation.
    Materials and methods: Multicentre retrospective observational study on 730
    adult patients in septic shock consecutively admitted to eight European ICUs
    between 2011 and 2013. Three timepoints were selected: T1 (ﬁrst hour of
    infusion of norepinephrine), Tpeak (time of highest dose during the ﬁrst 24
    h of treatment), and T24 (24-h post-T1). Binary logistic regression models
    were constructed for the three time-points.

    Results: Overall ICU mortality was 38.4%. Mortality was higher in those
    requiring high-dose (≥0.3 mcg/kg/min) versus low-dose (b0.3 mcg/kg/min)
    norepinephrine at T1 (53.4% vs 30.6%; p b 0.001) and T24 (61.4% vs 20.4%; p
    b 0.0001). Patients requiring high-dose with concurrent tachycardia had
    higher mortality at T1; in the lowdose group tachycardia was not associated
    with mortality. Resolving tachycardia (from T1 to T24) was associated with
    lower mortality compared to patients where tachycardia persisted (27.8% vs
    46.4%; p = 0.001).

    Conclusions: Use of high-dose norepinephrine and concurrent tachycardia are
    associated with poor outcomes in septic shock.

    A 40-year-old man with no cardiac history presented with central chest pain
    8 days after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine against COVID-19. Initial
    blood tests demonstrated a thrombocytopaenia (24×109 μg/L) and a raised
    d-dimer (>110 000 μg/L), and he was urgently transferred to our tertiary
    referral central for suspected vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopaenia and
    thrombosis (VITT). He developed dynamic ischaemic electrocardiographic
    changes with ST elevation, a troponin of 3185 ng/L, and regional wall motion
    abnormalities. An occlusion of his left anterior descending coronary artery
    was seen on CT coronary angiography. His platelet factor-4 (PF-4) antibody
    returned strongly positive. He was urgently treated for presumed VITT with
    intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and plasma exchange, but
    remained thrombocytopaenic and was initiated on rituximab. Argatroban was
    used for anticoagulation for his myocardial infarction while he remained
    thrombocytopaenic. After 6 days, his platelet count improved, and his PF-4
    antibody level, troponin and d-dimer fell. He was successfully discharged
    after 14 days.

    Background

    Children aged younger than 3 years were excluded from the ELIANA phase 2
    trial of tisagenlecleucel in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
    The feasibility, safety, and activity of tisagenlecleucel have not been
    defined in this group, the majority of whom have high-risk
    (KMT2A-rearranged) infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and historically
    poor outcomes despite intensification of chemotherapy, and for whom novel
    therapies are urgently needed. We aimed to provide real-world outcome
    analysis of the feasibility, activity, and safety of tisagenlecleucel in
    younger children and infants with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

    Methods

    We did an international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study at 15
    hospitals across ten countries in Europe. Eligible patients were children
    aged younger than 3 years at screening between Sept 1, 2018, and Sept 1,
    2021, who were screened for tisagenlecleucel therapy for relapsed or
    refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia according to
    licensed indications. Patients received a single intravenous infusion of
    tisagenlecleucel. We tracked chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy
    outcomes using a standardised data reporting form. Overall survival,
    event-free survival, stringent event-free survival, B-cell aplasia, and
    toxicity were assessed in all patients who received a tisagenlecleucel
    infusion.

    Findings

    38 eligible patients were screened, of whom 35 (92%) received a
    tisagenlecleucel infusion. 29 (76%) of 38 patients had KMT2A-rearranged
    acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and 25 (66%) had relapsed after previous
    allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients had
    previously received a median of 2 lines (IQR 2–3) of (non-HSCT) therapy.
    Seven (18%) of 38 patients had received inotuzumab and 14 (37%) had received
    blinatumomab. After a median of 14 months (IQR 9–21) of follow-up, overall
    survival at 12 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion was 84% (64–93; five
    patients had died), event-free survival was 69% (47–83; nine events), and
    stringent event-free survival was 41% (23–58; 18 events). The probability of
    ongoing B-cell aplasia was 70% (95% CI 46–84; seven events) at 12 months.
    Adverse events included cytokine release syndrome, which occurred at any
    grade in 21 (60%) of 35 patients and at grade 3 or worse in five (14%), and
    neurotoxicity at any grade in nine (26%), none of which were severe.
    Measurable residual disease-negative complete response with or without
    haematological recovery occurred in 24 (86%) of 28 patients who had
    measurable disease.

    Interpretation

    These data suggest that tisagenlecleucel has antitumour activity and has an
    acceptable safety profile for young children and infants with B-cell
    precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

    Funding

    None.

    Objective
                  To offer a quantitative risk–benefit analysis of two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adolescents in England.
                
                
                  Setting
                  England.
                
                
                  Design
                  Following the risk–benefit analysis methodology carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control, we calculated historical rates of hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit admission and death for ascertained SARS-CoV-2 cases in children aged 12–17 in England. We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence.
                
                
                  Participants
                  All 12–17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre.
                
                
                  Main outcome measures
                  Hospitalisations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12–17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence.
                
                
                  Results
                  At high future case incidence of 1000/100,000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100,000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and two deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100,000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Given the current (as at 15 September 2021) high case rates (680/100,000 population/week in 10–19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2.

    ABSTRACT
              
                Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models trained on long-term patient trajectories held as medical codes in electronic health records (EHR) have the potential to improve disease prediction. Anticoagulant prescribing decisions in atrial fibrillation (AF) offer a use case where the benchmark stroke risk prediction tool (CHA

In this study, we design and build the first DL and ML pipeline that uses the routinely updated, linked EHR data for 56 million people in England accessed via NHS Digital to predict first ischaemic stroke in people with AF, and as a secondary outcome, COVID-19 death. Our pipeline improves first stroke prediction in AF by 17% compared to CHA

    Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) has demonstrated efficacy in computer
    imaging and other self-contained digital workflows, but has failed to
    substantially impact routine clinical care. This is no longer because of
    poor adoption of Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H
    needs an infrastructure for development, deployment and evaluation within
    the healthcare institution. In this paper, we propose a design pattern
    called a Clinical Deployment Environment (CDE). We sketch the five pillars
    of the CDE: (1) real world development supported by live data where ML4H
    teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside (2) an ML-Ops platform
    that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment to ML4H (3)
    design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4) the methods
    of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to influence
    the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation that
    uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended
    to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in
    establishing the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition
    from “real-world” data to “real-world” development.

    Purpose:  To estimate the effect of prompt admission to critical care on
    mortality for deteriorating ward patients.

    Methods:  We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive ward
    patients assessed for critical care. Prompt admissions (within 4 h of
    assessment) were compared to a ‘watchful waiting’ cohort. We used critical
    care strain (bed occupancy) as a natural randomisation event that would
    predict prompt transfer to critical care. Strain was classified as low,
    medium or high (2+, 1 or 0 empty beds). This instrumental variable (IV)
    analysis was repeated for the subgroup of referrals with a recommendation
    for critical care once assessed. Risk-adjusted 90-day survival models were
    also constructed.

    Results:  A total of 12,380 patients from 48 hospitals were available for
    analysis. There were 2411 (19%) prompt admissions (median delay 1 h, IQR
    1–2) and 9969 (81%) controls; 1990 (20%) controls were admitted later
    (median delay 11 h, IQR 6–26). Prompt admissions were less frequent
    (p < 0.0001) as strain increased from low (22%), to medium (15%) to high
    (9%); the median delay to admission was 3, 4 and 5 h respectively. In the IV
    analysis, prompt admission reduced 90-day mortality by 7.4% (95% CI
    1.7–18.5%, p = 0.117) overall, and 16.2% (95% CI 1.1–31.3%, p = 0.036) for
    those recommended for critical care. In the risk-adjust survival model,
    90-day mortality was similar.

    Conclusion:  After allowing for unobserved prognostic differences between
    the groups, we find that prompt admission to critical care leads to lower
    90-day mortality for patients assessed and recommended to critical care.

    Postoperative critical care is a ﬁnite resource that is recommended for
    high-risk patients. Despite national recommendations specifying that such
    patients should receive postoperative critical care, there is evidence that
    these recommendations are not universally followed. We performed a national
    survey aiming to better understand how patients are risk-stratiﬁed in
    practice; elucidate clinicians’ opinions about how patients should be
    selected for critical care; and determine factors which affect the actual
    provision of postoperative critical care. As part of the second Sprint
    National Anaesthesia Project, epidemiology of critical care after surgery
    study, we distributed a paper survey to anaesthetists, surgeons and
    intensivists providing peri-operative care during a single week in March
    2017. We collected data on respondent characteristics, and their opinions of
    postoperative critical care provision, potential beneﬁts and real-world
    challenges. We undertook both quantitative and qualitative analyses to
    interpret the responses. We received 10,383 survey responses from 237
    hospitals across the UK. Consultants used a lower threshold for critical
    care admission than other career grades, indicating potentially more
    risk-averse behaviour. The majority of respondents reported that critical
    care provision was inadequate, and cited the value of critical care as being
    predominantly due to higher nurse: patient ratios. Use of objective risk
    assessment tools was poor, and patients were commonly selected for critical
    care based on procedure-speciﬁc pathways rather than individualised risk
    assessment. Challenges were highlighted in the delivery of peri-operative
    critical care services, such as an overall lack of capacity, competition for
    beds with non-surgical cases and poor ﬂow through the hospital leading to
    bed ‘blockages’. Critical care is perceived to provide beneﬁt to high-risk
    surgical patients, but there is variation in practice about the deﬁnition
    and determination of risk, how patients are referred and how to deal with
    the lack of critical care resources. Future work should focus on evaluating
    ‘enhanced care’ units for postoperative patients, how to better implement
    individualised risk assessment in practice, and how to improve patient ﬂow
    through hospitals.

    Background: Instrumental variable (IV) analysis can estimate treatment
    effects in the presence of residual or unmeasured confounding. In settings
    wherein measures of baseline risk severity are unavailable, IV designs are,
    therefore, particularly appealing, but, where established measures of risk
    severity are available, it is unclear whether IV methods are preferable.

    Objective: We compared regression with an IV design to estimate the effect
    of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer on mortality in a study with
    well-established measures of risk severity. Research Design: We use ICU bed
    availability at the time of assessment for ICU transfer as an instrument.
    Bed availability increases the chance of ICU admission, contains little
    information about patient characteristics, and it is unlikely that bed
    availability has any direct effect on in-hospital mortality. Subjects: We
    used a cohort study of deteriorating ward patients assessed for critical
    care unit admission, in 49 UK National Health Service hospitals between
    November 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011. Measures: Detailed demographic,
    physiological, and comorbidity data were collected for all patients.

    Results: The risk adjustment methods reported that, after controlling for
    all measured covariates including measures of risk severity, ICU transfer
    was associated with higher 28-day mortality, with a risk difference of 7.2%
    (95% conﬁdence interval = 5.3%–9.1%). The IV estimate of ICU transfer was
    −5.4% (95% conﬁdence interval = −47.1% to 36.3%) and applies to the
    subsample of patients whose transfer was “encouraged” by bed availability.

    Conclusions: IV estimates indicate that ICU care is beneﬁcial but are
    imprecisely estimated. Risk-adjusted estimates are more precise

    Instrumental variable methods, subject to appropriate identiﬁcation
    assumptions, enable consistent estimation of causal effects in the presence
    of unobserved confounding. Near–far matching has been proposed as one
    analytic method to improve inference by strengthening the effect of the
    instrument on the exposure and balancing observable characteristics between
    groups of subjects with low and high values of the instrument. However, in
    settings with hierarchical data (e.g. patients nested within hospitals), or
    where several covariate interactions must be balanced, conventional near–far
    matching algorithms may fail to achieve the requisite covariate balance. We
    develop a new matching algorithm, that combines near–far matching with
    reﬁned covariate balance, to balance large numbers of nominal covariates
    while also strengthening the instrumental variable. This extension of
    near–far matching is motivated by a case-study that aims to identify the
    causal effect of prompt admission to an intensive care unit on 7-day and
    28-day mortality.

    Pretreatment selection or censoring (“selection on treatment”) can occur
    when two treatment levels are compared ignoring the third option of neither
    treatment, in “censoring by death” settings where treatment is only defined
    for those who survive long enough to receive it, or in general in studies
    where the treatment is only defined for a subset of the population.
    Unfortunately, the standard instrumental variable (IV) estimand is not
    defined in the presence of such selection, so we consider estimating a new
    survivor-complier causal effect. Although this effect is generally not
    identified under standard IV assumptions, it is possible to construct sharp
    bounds. We derive these bounds and give a corresponding data-driven
    sensitivity analysis, along with nonparametric yet efficient estimation
    methods. Importantly, our approach allows for high-dimensional confounding
    adjustment, and valid inference even after employing machine learning.
    Incorporating covariates can tighten bounds dramatically, especially when
    they are strong predictors of the selection process. We apply the methods in
    a UK cohort study of critical care patients to examine the mortality effects
    of prompt admission to the intensive care unit, using ICU bed availability
    as an instrument. Supplementary materials for this article are available
    online.

    Machine learning for hospital operations is under-studied. We present a
    prediction pipeline that uses live electronic health-records for patients in
    a UK teaching hospital’s emergency department (ED) to generate short-term,
    probabilistic forecasts of emergency admissions. A set of XGBoost
    classifiers applied to 109,465 ED visits yielded AUROCs from 0.82 to 0.90
    depending on elapsed visit-time at the point of prediction. Patient-level
    probabilities of admission were aggregated to forecast the number of
    admissions among current ED patients and, incorporating patients yet to
    arrive, total emergency admissions within specified time-windows. The
    pipeline gave a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.0 admissions (mean percentage
    error of 17%) versus 6.5 (32%) for a benchmark metric. Models developed with
    104,504 later visits during the Covid-19 pandemic gave AUROCs of 0.68–0.90
    and MAE of 4.2 (30%) versus a 4.9 (33%) benchmark. We discuss how we
    surmounted challenges of designing and implementing models for real-time
    use, including temporal framing, data preparation, and changing operational
    conditions.

    Background:
                  Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a prothrombotic state, but long-term effects of COVID-19 on incidence of vascular diseases are unclear.
                
                
                  Methods:
                  We studied vascular diseases after COVID-19 diagnosis in population-wide anonymized linked English and Welsh electronic health records from January 1 to December 7, 2020. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing the incidence of arterial thromboses and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence in people without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted subgroup analyses by COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and previous history.
                
                
                  Results:
                  Among 48 million adults, 125 985 were hospitalized and 1 319 789 were not hospitalized within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. In England, there were 260 279 first arterial thromboses and 59 421 first VTEs during 41.6 million person-years of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios for first arterial thrombosis after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with no COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 21.7 (95% CI, 21.0–22.4) in week 1 after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1.34 (95% CI, 1.21–1.48) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios for first VTE after COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 33.2 (95% CI, 31.3–35.2) in week 1 to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.50–2.17) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios were higher, for longer after diagnosis, after hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, among Black or Asian versus White people, and among people without versus with a previous event. The estimated whole-population increases in risk of arterial thromboses and VTEs 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, corresponding to 7200 and 3500 additional events, respectively, after 1.4 million COVID-19 diagnoses.
                
                
                  Conclusions:
                  High relative incidence of vascular events soon after COVID-19 diagnosis declines more rapidly for arterial thromboses than VTEs. However, incidence remains elevated up to 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. These results support policies to prevent severe COVID-19 by means of COVID-19 vaccines, early review after discharge, risk factor control, and use of secondary preventive agents in high-risk patients.

    Introduction
                  Hospitals are complex systems and optimising their function is critical to the provision of high quality, cost effective healthcare. Metrics of performance have to date focused on the performance of individual elements rather than the whole system. Manipulation of individual elements of a complex system without an integrative understanding of its function is undesirable and may lead to counterintuitive outcomes and a holistic metric of hospital function might help design more efficient services.
                
                
                  Objectives
                  We aimed to use network analysis to characterise the structure of the system of perioperative care for emergency surgical admissions in our tertiary care hospital.
                
                
                  Design
                  We constructed a weighted directional network representation of the emergency surgical services using patient location data from electronic health records.
                
                
                  Setting
                  A single-centre tertiary care hospital in the UK.
                
                
                  Participants
                  We selected data from the retrospective electronic health record data of all unplanned admissions with a surgical intervention during their stay during a 3.5-year period, which resulted in a set of 16 500 individual admissions.
                
                
                  Methods
                  We then constructed and analysed the structure of this network using established methods from network science such as degree distribution, betweenness centrality and small-world characteristics.
                
                
                  Results
                  The analysis showed the service to be a complex system with scale-free, small-world network properties. We also identified such potential hubs and bottlenecks in the system.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Our holistic, system-wide description of a hospital service may provide tools to inform service improvement initiatives and gives us insights into the architecture of a complex system of care. The implications for the structure and resilience of the service is that while being robust in general, the system may be vulnerable to outages at specific key nodes.

    Objectives
                  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health problem, whose management in low-resource settings is hampered by fragile health systems and lack of access to specialist services. Improvement is complex, given the interaction of multiple people, processes and institutions. We aimed to develop a mixed-method approach to understand the TBI pathway based on the lived experience of local people, supported by quantitative methodologies and to determine potential improvement targets.
                
                
                  Design
                  We describe a systems approach based on narrative exploration, participatory diagramming, data collection and discrete event simulation (DES), conducted by an international research collaborative.
                
                
                  Setting
                  The study is set in the tertiary neurotrauma centre in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, in 2019–2020 (prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic).
                
                
                  Participants
                  The qualitative work involved 40 workshop participants and 64 interviewees to explore the views of a wide range of stakeholders including staff, patients and relatives. The 1-month retrospective admission snapshot covered 85 surgical neurotrauma admissions.
                
                
                  Results
                  The TBI pathway was outlined, with system boundaries defined around the management of TBI once admitted to the neurosurgical unit. Retrospective data showed 18% mortality, 71% discharge to home and an 11% referral rate. DES was used to investigate the system, showing its vulnerability to small surges in patient numbers, with critical points being CT scanning and observation ward beds. This explorative model indicated that a modest expansion of observation ward beds to 30 would remove the flow-limitations and indicated possible consequences of changes.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  A systems approach to improving TBI care in resource-poor settings may be supported by simulation and informed by qualitative work to ground it in the direct experience of those involved. Narrative interviews, participatory diagramming and DES represent one possible suite of methods deliverable within an international partnership. Findings can support targeted improvement investments despite coexisting resource limitations while indicating concomitant risks.

    Graphical models have emerged as a tool to map out the interplay between
    multiple measured and unmeasured variables, and can help strengthen the case
    for a causal association between exposures and outcomes in observational
    studies. In Part 1 of this methods series, we will introduce the reader to
    graphical models for causal inference in perioperative medicine, and set the
    framework for Part 2 of the series involving advanced methods for causal
    inference.

    Although RCTs represent the gold standard in clinical research, most
    clinical questions cannot be answered using this technique, because of
    ethical considerations, time, and cost. The goal of observational research
    in clinical medicine is to gain insight into the relationship between a
    clinical exposure and patient outcome, in the absence of evidence from RCTs.
    Observational research offers additional beneﬁt when compared with data from
    RCTs: the conclusions are often more generalisable to a heterogenous
    population, which may be of greater value to everyday clinical practice. In
    Part 2 of this methods series, we will introduce the reader to several
    advanced methods for supporting the case for causality between an exposure
    and outcome, including: mediation analysis, natural experiments, and joint
    effects methods.

    Background:  An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians
    request novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to
    the treatment of a specific patient. However, the availability of such
    consultations is lacking. We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a
    situation where a treatment indication and contraindication coexist in the
    same patient, i.e., anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient
    with both atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis.

    Methods:  We examined four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on
    stroke risk or all-cause mortality from: (1) randomised controlled trials
    (RCTs), (2) meta-analysis of prior observational studies, (3) trial
    emulation (using population electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and
    (4) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation). We developed prototype forms
    to request an Informatics Consult and return of results in electronic health
    record systems.

    Results:  We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with
    AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three new sources of
    evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational studies showed
    that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio
    [HR] = 0.71, CI 0.39–1.29). In a target trial emulation, warfarin was
    associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61, CI 0.49–0.76) and
    ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27, CI 0.08–0.91). Mendelian randomisation served
    as a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1
    (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk.
    A pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85%
    of clinicians found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought
    that they should have access to the Informatics Consult as a service within
    their healthcare systems. We identified candidate steps for automation to
    scale evidence generation and to accelerate the return of results.

    Conclusion:  We performed a proof-of-concept Informatics Consult for
    evidence generation, which may inform treatment decisions in situations
    where there is dearth of randomised trials. Patients are surprised to know
    that their

    Introduction The admission of high-risk patients to critical care after
    surgery is a recommended standard of care. Nevertheless, poor compliance
    against this recommendation has been repeatedly demonstrated in large
    epidemiological studies. It is unclear whether this is due to reasons of
    capacity, equipoise, poor quality clinical care or because hospitals are
    working creatively to create capacity for augmented care on normal surgical
    wards. The EPIdemiology of Critical Care after Surgery study aims to address
    these uncertainties. Methods and analysis One-week observational cohort
    study in the UK and Australasia. All patients undergoing inpatient
    (overnight stay) surgery will be included. All will have prospective data
    collection on risk factors, surgical procedure and postoperative outcomes
    including the primary outcome of morbidity (measured using the Postoperative
    Morbidity Survey on day 7 after surgery) and secondary outcomes including
    length of stay and mortality. Data will also be collected on critical care
    referral and admission, surgical cancellations and critical care occupancy.
    The epidemiology of patient characteristics, processes and outcomes will be
    described. Inferential techniques (multilevel multivariable regression,
    propensity score matching and instrumental variable analysis) will be used
    to evaluate the relationship between critical care admission and
    postoperative outcome. Ethics and dissemination The study has received
    ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service in the UK and
    equivalent in Australasia. The collection of patient identi able data
    without prior consent has been approved by the Con dentiality Advisory Group
    (England and Wales) and the Public Privacy and Patient Bene t Panel
    (Scotland). In these countries, patient identi able data will be used to
    link prospectively collected data with national registers of death and
    inpatient administrative data. The study ndings will be disseminated using a
    multimedia approach with the support of our lay collaborators, to patients,
    public, policymakers, clinical and academic audiences.

    Background. Previous studies have suggested that there may be long-term harm
    associated with postoperative complications. Uncertainty exists however,
    because of the need for risk adjustment and inconsistent deﬁnitions of
    postoperative morbidity.

    Methods. We did a longitudinal observational cohort study of patients
    undergoing major surgery. Case-mix adjustment was applied and morbidity was
    recorded using a validated outcome measure. Cox proportional hazards
    modelling using time-dependent covariates was used to measure the
    independent relationship between prolonged postoperative morbidity and
    longer term survival.

    Results. Data were analysed for 1362 patients. The median length of stay was
    9 days and the median follow-up time was 6.5 yr. Independent of
    perioperative risk, postoperative neurological morbidity (prevalence 2.9%)
    was associated with a relative hazard for longterm mortality of 2.00
    [P¼0.001; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.32 –3.04]. Prolonged postoperative
    morbidity (prevalence 15.6%) conferred a relative hazard for death in the
    ﬁrst 12 months after surgery of 3.51 (P,0.001; 95% CI 2.28 –5.42) and for
    the next 2 yr of 2.44 (P,0.001; 95% CI 1.62–3.65), returning to baseline
    thereafter.

    Conclusions. Prolonged morbidity after surgery is associated with a risk of
    premature death for a longer duration than perhaps is commonly thought;
    however, this risk falls with time. We suggest that prolonged postoperative
    morbidity measured in this way may be a valid indicator of the quality of
    surgical healthcare. Our ﬁndings reinforce the importance of research and
    quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing the duration and severity
    of postoperative complications.

    Improved outcomes for acutely unwell patients are predicated on early
    identification of deterioration, accelerating the time to accurate diagnosis
    of the underlying condition, selection and titration of treatments that
    target biological phenotypes, and personalised endpoints to achieve optimal
    benefit yet minimise iatrogenic harm. Technological developments entering
    routine clinical practice over the next decade will deliver a sea change in
    patient management. Enhanced point of care diagnostics, more sophisticated
    physiological and biochemical monitoring with superior analytics and
    computeraided support tools will all add considerable artificial
    intelligence to complement clinical skills. Experts in different fields of
    emergency and critical care medicine offer their perspectives as to which
    research developments could make a big difference within the next decade.

    We conducted a 5-year retrospective cohort study on women undergoing
    caesarean section to investigate factors influencing the operating
    room-to-incision interval. Time-to-event analysis was performed for
    category-1 caesarean section using a Cox proportional hazards regression
    model. Covariates included: anaesthetic technique; body mass index; age;
    parity; time of delivery; and gestational age. Binary logistic regression
    was performed for 5-min Apgar score ≥ 7. There were 677 women who underwent
    category-1 caesarean section and who met the entry criteria. Unadjusted
    median (IQR \[range]) operating room-to-incision intervals were: epidural
    top-up 11 (7–17 \[0–87]) min; general anaesthesia 6 (4–11 \[0–69]) min;
    spinal 13 (10–20 \[0–83]) min; and combined spinal-epidural 24 (13–35
    \[0–75]) min. Cox regression showed general anaesthesia to be the most rapid
    method with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.97 (1.60–2.44; p < 0.0001), followed
    by epidural top-up (reference group), spinal anaesthesia 0.79 (0.65–0.96; p
    = 0.02) and combined spinal-epidural 0.48 (0.35–0.67; p < 0.0001).
    Underweight and overweight body mass indexes were associated with longer
    operating room-to-incision intervals. General anaesthesia was associated
    with fewer 5-min Apgar scores ≥ 7 with an odds ratio (95%CI) of 0.28
    (0.11–0.68; p < 0.01). There was no difference in neonatal outcomes between
    the first and fifth quintiles for operating room-to-incision intervals.
    General anaesthesia is associated with the most rapid operating
    room-to-incision interval for category-1 caesarean section, but is also
    associated with worse short term neonatal outcomes. Longer operating
    room-to-incision intervals were not associated with worse neonatal outcomes.

    Abstract
              
                Background
                The link between ethnicity and healthcare inequity, and the urgency for better data is well-recognised. This study describes ethnicity data in nation-wide electronic health records in England, UK.
              
              
                Methods
                We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified person-level records for the England population available in the National Health Service (NHS) Digital trusted research environment. Primary care records (GDPPR) were linked to hospital and national mortality records. We assessed completeness, consistency, and granularity of ethnicity records using all available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity and NHS ethnicity categories.
              
              
                Findings
                From 61.8 million individuals registered with a primary care practice in England, 51.5 (83.3%) had at least one ethnicity record in GDPPR, increasing to 93·9% when linked with hospital records. Approximately 12·0% had at least two conflicting ethnicity codes in primary care records. Women were more likely to have ethnicity recorded than men. Ethnicity was missing most frequently in individuals from 18 to 39 years old and in the southern regions of England. Individuals with an ethnicity record had more comorbidities recorded than those without. Of 489 SNOMED-CT ethnicity concepts available, 255 were used in primary care records. Discrepancies between SNOMED-CT and NHS ethnicity categories were observed, specifically within “Other-” ethnicity groups.
              
              
                Interpretation
                More than 250 ethnicity sub-groups may be found in health records for the English population, although commonly categorised into “White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Mixed”, and “Other”. One in ten individuals do not have ethnicity information recorded in primary care or hospital records. SNOMED-CT codes represent more diversity in ethnicity groups than the NHS ethnicity classification. Improved recording of self-reported ethnicity at first point-of-care and consistency in ethnicity classification across healthcare settings can potentially improve the accuracy of ethnicity in research and ultimately care for all ethnicities.

                Research in context
                
                  Evidence before this study
                  
                    Ethnicity has been highlighted as a significant factor in the disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Better knowledge of ethnicity data recorded in real clinical practice is required to improve health research and ultimately healthcare. We searched PubMed from database inception to 14
                    th
                    July 2022 for publications using the search terms “ethnicity” and “electronic health records” or “EHR,” without language restrictions. 228 publications in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 304 publications between 2020 and 2022 were identified. However, none of these publications used or reported any of over 400 available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity to account for more granularity and diversity than captured by traditional high-level classification limited to 5 to 9 ethnicity groups.
                  
                
                
                  Added value of this study
                  We provide a comprehensive study of the largest collection of ethnicity records from a national-level electronic health records trusted research environment, exploring completeness, consistency, and granularity. This work can serve as a data resource profile of ethnicity from routinely-collected EHR in England.
                
                
                  Implications of all the available evidence
                  To achieve equity in healthcare, we need to understand the differences between individuals, as well as the influence of ethnicity both on health status and on health interventions, including variation in the behaviour of tests and therapies. Thus, there is a need for measurements, thresholds, and risk estimates to be tailored to different ethnic groups. This study presents the different medical concepts describing ethnicity in routinely collected data that are readily available to researchers and highlights key elements for improving their accuracy in research. We aim to encourage researchers to use more granular ethnicity than the than typical approaches which aggregate ethnicity into a limited number of categories, failing to reflect the diversity of underlying populations. Accurate ethnicity data will lead to a better understanding of individual diversity, which will help to address disparities and influence policy recommendations that can translate into better, fairer health for all.

    OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of sepsis in critical care by
    applying the Sepsis-3 criteria to electronic health records. DESIGN:
    Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records. SETTING: Ten
    ICUs from four U.K. National Health Service hospital trusts contributing to
    the National Institute for Health Research Critical Care Health Informatics
    Collaborative. PATIENTS: A total of 28,456 critical care admissions (14,332
    emergency medical, 4,585 emergency surgical, and 9,539 elective surgical).

    MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine thousand three hundred
    forty-three episodes of clinical deterioration were identified with a rise
    in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of at least 2 points, of which
    14,869 (50.7%) were associated with antibiotic escalation and thereby met
    the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis. A total of 4,100 episodes of sepsis
    (27.6%) were associated with vasopressor use and lactate greater than 2.0
    mmol/L, and therefore met the Sepsis-3 criteria for septic shock. ICU
    mortality by source of sepsis was highest for ICU-acquired sepsis (23.7%;
    95% CI, 21.9–25.6%), followed by hospitalacquired sepsis (18.6%; 95% CI,
    17.5–19.9%), and community-acquired sepsis (12.9%; 95% CI, 12.1–13.6%) (p
    for comparison less than 0.0001).

    CONCLUSIONS: We successfully operationalized the Sepsis-3 criteria to an
    electronic health record dataset to describe the characteristics of critical
    care patients with sepsis. This may facilitate sepsis research using
    electronic health record data at scale without relying on human coding.

    Clinical trials often fail to recruit an adequate number of appropriate
    patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is resource-intensive when
    relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care
    settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic
    health records (EHR) may help, but much of the information is in free text
    rather than a computable form. We applied natural language processing (NLP)
    to free text EHR data using the CogStack platform to simulate recruitment
    into the LeoPARDS study, a clinical trial aiming to reduce organ dysfunction
    in septic shock. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using
    a moving 1-hour time window, and compared patients identiﬁed by our approach
    with those actually screened and recruited for the trial, for the time
    period that data were available. We manually reviewed records of a random
    sample of patients identiﬁed by the algorithm but not screened in the
    original trial. Our method identiﬁed 376 patients, including 34 patients
    with EHR data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our
    centre. The sensitivity of CogStack for identifying patients screened was
    90% (95% CI 85%, 93%). Of the 203 patients identiﬁed by both manual
    screening and CogStack, the index date matched in 95 (47%) and CogStack was
    earlier in 94 (47%). In conclusion, analysis of EHR data using NLP could
    effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify
    some eligible patients at an earlier stage, potentially improving trial
    recruitment if implemented in real time.

    Abstract
                
                  Atrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered condition in critical illness and causes adverse effects including haemodynamic decompensation, stroke and prolonged hospital stay. It is a common practice in critical care to supplement serum magnesium for the purpose of preventing episodes of atrial fibrillation. However, no randomised studies support this practice in the non-cardiac surgery critical care population, and the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation is unclear. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in preventing the onset of atrial fibrillation in a mixed critical care population. We conducted a single centre retrospective observational study of adult critical care patients. We utilised a natural experiment design, using the supplementation preference of the bedside critical care nurse as an instrumental variable. Using routinely collected electronic patient data, magnesium supplementation opportunities were defined and linked to the bedside nurse. Nurse preference for administering magnesium was obtained using multilevel modelling. The results were used to define "liberal" and "restrictive" supplementation groups, which were inputted into an instrumental variable regression to obtain an estimate of the effect of magnesium supplementation. 9114 magnesium supplementation opportunities were analysed, representing 2137 critical care admissions for 1914 patients. There was significant variation in magnesium supplementation practices attributable to the individual nurse, after accounting for covariates. The instrumental variable analysis showed magnesium supplementation was associated with a 3% decreased relative risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation event (95% CI − 0.06 to − 0.004,
                  p
                   = 0.03). This study supports the strategy of routine supplementation, but further work is required to identify optimal serum magnesium targets for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.

    Introduction
                  Many routinely administered treatments lack evidence as to their effectiveness. When treatments lack evidence, patients receive varying care based on the preferences of clinicians. Standard randomised controlled trials are unsuited to comparisons of different routine treatment strategies, and there remains little economic incentive for change.
                  Integrating clinical trial infrastructure into electronic health record systems offers the potential for routine treatment comparisons at scale, through reduced trial costs. To date, embedded trials have automated data collection, participant identification and eligibility screening, but randomisation and consent remain manual and therefore costly tasks.
                  This study will investigate the feasibility of using computer prompts to allow flexible randomisation at the point of clinical decision making. It will compare the effectiveness of two prompt designs through the lens of a candidate research question—comparing liberal or restrictive magnesium supplementation practices for critical care patients. It will also explore the acceptability of two consent models for conducting comparative effectiveness research.
                
                
                  Methods and analysis
                  We will conduct a single centre, mixed-methods feasibility study, aiming to recruit 50 patients undergoing elective surgery requiring postoperative critical care admission. Participants will be randomised to either ‘Nudge’ or ‘Preference’ designs of electronic point-of-care randomisation prompt, and liberal or restrictive magnesium supplementation.
                  We will judge feasibility through a combination of study outcomes. The primary outcome will be the proportion of prompts displayed resulting in successful randomisation events (compliance with the allocated magnesium strategy). Secondary outcomes will evaluate the acceptability of both prompt designs to clinicians and ascertain the acceptability of pre-emptive and opt-out consent models to patients.

    Background: Cancellation of planned surgery impacts substantially on
    patients and health systems. This study describes the incidence and reasons
    for cancellation of inpatient surgery in the UK NHS. Methods: We conducted a
    prospective observational cohort study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017
    in 245 NHS hospitals. Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical
    cancellations were recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we
    identified patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation
    due to inadequate bed capacity. Results: We analysed data from 14 936
    patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients (10.0%)
    reported previous cancellation for the same procedure; contemporaneous
    hospital census data indicated that 13.9% patients attending inpatient
    operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. Non-clinical reasons,
    predominantly inadequate bed capacity, accounted for a large proportion of
    previous cancellations. Independent risk factors for cancellation due to
    inadequate bed capacity included requirement for postoperative critical care
    \[odds ratio (OR)¼2.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.12e4.02; P<0.001]
    and the presence of an emergency department in the treating hospital
    (OR¼4.18; 95% CI, 2.22e7.89; P<0.001). Patients undergoing cancer surgery
    (OR¼0.32; 95% CI, 0.22e0.46; P<0.001), obstetric procedures (OR¼0.17; 95%
    CI, 0.08e0.32; P<0.001), and expedited surgery (OR¼0.39; 95% CI, 0.27e0.56;
    P<0.001) were less likely to be cancelled.

    Background Preoperative risk prediction is important for guiding clinical
    decision-making and resource allocation. Clinicians frequently rely solely
    on their own clinical judgement for risk prediction rather than objective
    measures. We aimed to compare the accuracy of freely available objective
    surgical risk tools with subjective clinical assessment in predicting 30-day
    mortality.

  abstract: >-
    Background: Decisions to admit high-risk postoperative patients to critical
    care may be affected by resource availability. We aimed to quantify adult
    ICU/high-dependency unit (ICU/HDU) capacity in hospitals from the UK,
    Australia, and New Zealand (NZ), and to identify and describe additional
    ‘high-acuity’ beds capable of managing high-risk patients outside the
    ICU/HDU environment.
