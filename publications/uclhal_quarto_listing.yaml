  abstract: "Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) has demonstrated efficacy in computer\
    \ imaging and other self-contained digital workflows, but has failed to substantially\
    \ impact routine clinical care. This is no longer because of poor adoption of\
    \ Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H needs an infrastructure\
    \ for development, deployment and evaluation within the healthcare institution.\
    \ In this paper, we propose a design pattern called a Clinical Deployment Environment\
    \ (CDE). We sketch the five pillars of the CDE: (1) real world development supported\
    \ by live data where ML4H teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside\
    \ (2) an ML-Ops platform that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment\
    \ to ML4H (3) design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4)\
    \ the methods of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to\
    \ influence the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation\
    \ that uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended\
    \ to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in establishing\
    \ the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition from \u201Creal-world\u201D\
    \ data to \u201Creal-world\u201D development."

  abstract: "Objectives\n              Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health\
    \ problem, whose management in low-resource settings is hampered by fragile health\
    \ systems and lack of access to specialist services. Improvement is complex, given\
    \ the interaction of multiple people, processes and institutions. We aimed to\
    \ develop a mixed-method approach to understand the TBI pathway based on the lived\
    \ experience of local people, supported by quantitative methodologies and to determine\
    \ potential improvement targets.\n            \n            \n              Design\n\
    \              We describe a systems approach based on narrative exploration,\
    \ participatory diagramming, data collection and discrete event simulation (DES),\
    \ conducted by an international research collaborative.\n            \n      \
    \      \n              Setting\n              The study is set in the tertiary\
    \ neurotrauma centre in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, in 2019\u20132020 (prior\
    \ to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic).\n            \n            \n              Participants\n\
    \              The qualitative work involved 40 workshop participants and 64 interviewees\
    \ to explore the views of a wide range of stakeholders including staff, patients\
    \ and relatives. The 1-month retrospective admission snapshot covered 85 surgical\
    \ neurotrauma admissions.\n            \n            \n              Results\n\
    \              The TBI pathway was outlined, with system boundaries defined around\
    \ the management of TBI once admitted to the neurosurgical unit. Retrospective\
    \ data showed 18% mortality, 71% discharge to home and an 11% referral rate. DES\
    \ was used to investigate the system, showing its vulnerability to small surges\
    \ in patient numbers, with critical points being CT scanning and observation ward\
    \ beds. This explorative model indicated that a modest expansion of observation\
    \ ward beds to 30 would remove the flow-limitations and indicated possible consequences\
    \ of changes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n       \
    \       A systems approach to improving TBI care in resource-poor settings may\
    \ be supported by simulation and informed by qualitative work to ground it in\
    \ the direct experience of those involved. Narrative interviews, participatory\
    \ diagramming and DES represent one possible suite of methods deliverable within\
    \ an international partnership. Findings can support targeted improvement investments\
    \ despite coexisting resource limitations while indicating concomitant risks."

  abstract: "Abstract\n          \n            Background\n            The link between\
    \ ethnicity and healthcare inequity, and the urgency for better data is well-recognised.\
    \ This study describes ethnicity data in nation-wide electronic health records\
    \ in England, UK.\n          \n          \n            Methods\n            We\
    \ conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified person-level records\
    \ for the England population available in the National Health Service (NHS) Digital\
    \ trusted research environment. Primary care records (GDPPR) were linked to hospital\
    \ and national mortality records. We assessed completeness, consistency, and granularity\
    \ of ethnicity records using all available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity and\
    \ NHS ethnicity categories.\n          \n          \n            Findings\n  \
    \          From 61.8 million individuals registered with a primary care practice\
    \ in England, 51.5 (83.3%) had at least one ethnicity record in GDPPR, increasing\
    \ to 93\xB79% when linked with hospital records. Approximately 12\xB70% had at\
    \ least two conflicting ethnicity codes in primary care records. Women were more\
    \ likely to have ethnicity recorded than men. Ethnicity was missing most frequently\
    \ in individuals from 18 to 39 years old and in the southern regions of England.\
    \ Individuals with an ethnicity record had more comorbidities recorded than those\
    \ without. Of 489 SNOMED-CT ethnicity concepts available, 255 were used in primary\
    \ care records. Discrepancies between SNOMED-CT and NHS ethnicity categories were\
    \ observed, specifically within \u201COther-\u201D ethnicity groups.\n       \
    \   \n          \n            Interpretation\n            More than 250 ethnicity\
    \ sub-groups may be found in health records for the English population, although\
    \ commonly categorised into \u201CWhite\u201D, \u201CBlack\u201D, \u201CAsian\u201D\
    , \u201CMixed\u201D, and \u201COther\u201D. One in ten individuals do not have\
    \ ethnicity information recorded in primary care or hospital records. SNOMED-CT\
    \ codes represent more diversity in ethnicity groups than the NHS ethnicity classification.\
    \ Improved recording of self-reported ethnicity at first point-of-care and consistency\
    \ in ethnicity classification across healthcare settings can potentially improve\
    \ the accuracy of ethnicity in research and ultimately care for all ethnicities.\n\
    \          \n          \n            Funding\n            British Heart Foundation\
    \ Data Science Centre led by Health Data Research UK.\n          \n          \n\
    \            Research in context\n            \n              Evidence before\
    \ this study\n              \n                Ethnicity has been highlighted as\
    \ a significant factor in the disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection\
    \ and mortality. Better knowledge of ethnicity data recorded in real clinical\
    \ practice is required to improve health research and ultimately healthcare. We\
    \ searched PubMed from database inception to 14\n                th\n        \
    \        July 2022 for publications using the search terms \u201Cethnicity\u201D\
    \ and \u201Celectronic health records\u201D or \u201CEHR,\u201D without language\
    \ restrictions. 228 publications in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 304\
    \ publications between 2020 and 2022 were identified. However, none of these publications\
    \ used or reported any of over 400 available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity\
    \ to account for more granularity and diversity than captured by traditional high-level\
    \ classification limited to 5 to 9 ethnicity groups.\n              \n       \
    \     \n            \n              Added value of this study\n              We\
    \ provide a comprehensive study of the largest collection of ethnicity records\
    \ from a national-level electronic health records trusted research environment,\
    \ exploring completeness, consistency, and granularity. This work can serve as\
    \ a data resource profile of ethnicity from routinely-collected EHR in England.\n\
    \            \n            \n              Implications of all the available evidence\n\
    \              To achieve equity in healthcare, we need to understand the differences\
    \ between individuals, as well as the influence of ethnicity both on health status\
    \ and on health interventions, including variation in the behaviour of tests and\
    \ therapies. Thus, there is a need for measurements, thresholds, and risk estimates\
    \ to be tailored to different ethnic groups. This study presents the different\
    \ medical concepts describing ethnicity in routinely collected data that are readily\
    \ available to researchers and highlights key elements for improving their accuracy\
    \ in research. We aim to encourage researchers to use more granular ethnicity\
    \ than the than typical approaches which aggregate ethnicity into a limited number\
    \ of categories, failing to reflect the diversity of underlying populations. Accurate\
    \ ethnicity data will lead to a better understanding of individual diversity,\
    \ which will help to address disparities and influence policy recommendations\
    \ that can translate into better, fairer health for all."
