- abstract: AbstractAtrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered
    condition in critical illness and causes adverse effects including
    haemodynamic decompensation, stroke and prolonged hospital stay. It
    is a common practice in critical care to supplement serum magnesium
    for the purpose of preventing episodes of atrial fibrillation.
    However, no randomised studies support this practice in the
    non-cardiac surgery critical care population, and the effectiveness
    of magnesium supplementation is unclear. We sought to investigate
    the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in preventing the
    onset of atrial fibrillation in a mixed critical care population. We
    conducted a single centre retrospective observational study of adult
    critical care patients. We utilised a natural experiment design,
    using the supplementation preference of the bedside critical care
    nurse as an instrumental variable. Using routinely collected
    electronic patient data, magnesium supplementation opportunities
    were defined and linked to the bedside nurse. Nurse preference for
    administering magnesium was obtained using multilevel modelling. The
    results were used to define \"liberal\" and \"restrictive\"
    supplementation groups, which were inputted into an instrumental
    variable regression to obtain an estimate of the effect of magnesium
    supplementation. 9114 magnesium supplementation opportunities were
    analysed, representing 2137 critical care admissions for 1914
    patients. There was significant variation in magnesium
    supplementation practices attributable to the individual nurse,
    after accounting for covariates. The instrumental variable analysis
    showed magnesium supplementation was associated with a 3% decreased
    relative risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation event (95%
    CI − 0.06 to − 0.004, p  = 0.03). This study supports the strategy
    of routine supplementation, but further work is required to identify
    optimal serum magnesium targets for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis.

- abstract: "Introduction Many routinely administered treatments lack
    evidence as to their effectiveness. When treatments lack evidence,
    patients receive varying care based on the preferences of
    clinicians. Standard randomised controlled trials are unsuited to
    comparisons of different routine treatment strategies, and there
    remains little economic incentive for change. Integrating clinical
    trial infrastructure into electronic health record systems offers
    the potential for routine treatment comparisons at scale, through
    reduced trial costs. To date, embedded trials have automated data
    collection, participant identification and eligibility screening,
    but randomisation and consent remain manual and therefore costly
    tasks. This study will investigate the feasibility of using computer
    prompts to allow flexible randomisation at the point of clinical
    decision making. It will compare the effectiveness of two prompt
    designs through the lens of a candidate research
    question---comparing liberal or restrictive magnesium
    supplementation practices for critical care patients. It will also
    explore the acceptability of two consent models for conducting
    comparative effectiveness research.Methods and analysis We will
    conduct a single centre, mixed-methods feasibility study, aiming to
    recruit 50 patients undergoing elective surgery requiring
    postoperative critical care admission. Participants will be
    randomised to either 'Nudge'Nudge or 'Preference'Preference designs
    of electronic point-of-care randomisation prompt, and liberal or
    restrictive magnesium supplementation. We will judge feasibility
    through a combination of study outcomes. The primary outcome will be
    the proportion of prompts displayed resulting in successful
    randomisation events (compliance with the allocated magnesium
    strategy). Secondary outcomes will evaluate the acceptability of
    both prompt designs to clinicians and ascertain the acceptability of
    pre-emptive and opt-out consent models to patients.Ethics and
    dissemination This study was approved by Riverside Research Ethics
    Committee (Ref: 21/LO/0785) and will be published on
    completion.Trial registration numberNCT05149820 ."

- abstract: "OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of sepsis in
    critical care by applying the Sepsis-3 criteria to electronic health
    records. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health
    records. SETTING: Ten ICUs from four U.K. National Health Service
    hospital trusts contributing to the National Institute for Health
    Research Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative. PATIENTS: A
    total of 28,456 critical care admissions (14,332 emergency medical,
    4,585 emergency surgical, and 9,539 elective surgical). MEASUREMENTS
    AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine thousand three hundred forty-three
    episodes of clinical deterioration were identified with a rise in
    Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of at least 2 points, of
    which 14,869 (50.7%) were associated with antibiotic escalation and
    thereby met the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis. A total of 4,100
    episodes of sepsis (27.6%) were associated with vasopressor use and
    lactate greater than 2.0 mmol/L, and therefore met the Sepsis-3
    criteria for septic shock. ICU mortality by source of sepsis was
    highest for ICU-acquired sepsis (23.7%; 95% CI, 21.9--25.6%),
    followed by hospitalacquired sepsis (18.6%; 95% CI, 17.5--19.9%),
    and community-acquired sepsis (12.9%; 95% CI, 12.1--13.6%) (p for
    comparison less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We successfully
    operationalized the Sepsis-3 criteria to an electronic health record
    dataset to describe the characteristics of critical care patients
    with sepsis. This may facilitate sepsis research using electronic
    health record data at scale without relying on human coding."

- abstract: Improved outcomes for acutely unwell patients are predicated
    on early identification of deterioration, accelerating the time to
    accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition, selection and
    titration of treatments that target biological phenotypes, and
    personalised endpoints to achieve optimal benefit yet minimise
    iatrogenic harm. Technological developments entering routine
    clinical practice over the next decade will deliver a sea change in
    patient management. Enhanced point of care diagnostics, more
    sophisticated physiological and biochemical monitoring with superior
    analytics and computeraided support tools will all add considerable
    artificial intelligence to complement clinical skills. Experts in
    different fields of emergency and critical care medicine offer their
    perspectives as to which research developments could make a big
    difference within the next decade.

- abstract: Background Children aged younger than 3 years were excluded
    from the ELIANA phase 2 trial of tisagenlecleucel in children with
    acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The feasibility, safety, and activity
    of tisagenlecleucel have not been defined in this group, the
    majority of whom have high-risk (KMT2A-rearranged) infant acute
    lymphoblastic leukaemia and historically poor outcomes despite
    intensification of chemotherapy, and for whom novel therapies are
    urgently needed. We aimed to provide real-world outcome analysis of
    the feasibility, activity, and safety of tisagenlecleucel in younger
    children and infants with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Methods We
    did an international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study at 15
    hospitals across ten countries in Europe. Eligible patients were
    children aged younger than 3 years at screening between Sept 1,
    2018, and Sept 1, 2021, who were screened for tisagenlecleucel
    therapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute
    lymphoblastic leukaemia according to licensed indications. Patients
    received a single intravenous infusion of tisagenlecleucel. We
    tracked chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy outcomes using a
    standardised data reporting form. Overall survival, event-free
    survival, stringent event-free survival, B-cell aplasia, and
    toxicity were assessed in all patients who received a
    tisagenlecleucel infusion. Findings 38 eligible patients were
    screened, of whom 35 (92%) received a tisagenlecleucel infusion. 29
    (76%) of 38 patients had KMT2A-rearranged acute lymphoblastic
    leukaemia, and 25 (66%) had relapsed after previous allogeneic
    haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients had
    previously received a median of 2 lines (IQR 2--3) of (non-HSCT)
    therapy. Seven (18%) of 38 patients had received inotuzumab and 14
    (37%) had received blinatumomab. After a median of 14 months (IQR
    9--21) of follow-up, overall survival at 12 months after
    tisagenlecleucel infusion was 84% (64--93; five patients had died),
    event-free survival was 69% (47--83; nine events), and stringent
    event-free survival was 41% (23--58; 18 events). The probability of
    ongoing B-cell aplasia was 70% (95% CI 46--84; seven events) at 12
    months. Adverse events included cytokine release syndrome, which
    occurred at any grade in 21 (60%) of 35 patients and at grade 3 or
    worse in five (14%), and neurotoxicity at any grade in nine (26%),
    none of which were severe. Measurable residual disease-negative
    complete response with or without haematological recovery occurred
    in 24 (86%) of 28 patients who had measurable disease.
    Interpretation These data suggest that tisagenlecleucel has
    antitumour activity and has an acceptable safety profile for young
    children and infants with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
    leukaemia. Funding None.

- abstract: "Abstract The increasing volume and richness of healthcare
    data collected during routine clinical practice have not yet
    translated into significant numbers of actionable insights that have
    systematically improved patient outcomes. An evidence-practice gap
    continues to exist in healthcare. We contest that this gap can be
    reduced by assessing the use of nudge theory as part of clinical
    decision support systems (CDSS). Deploying nudges to modify
    clinician behaviour and improve adherence to guideline-directed
    therapy represents an underused tool in bridging the
    evidence-practice gap. In conjunction with electronic health records
    (EHRs) and newer devices including artificial intelligence
    algorithms that are increasingly integrated within learning health
    systems, nudges such as CDSS alerts should be iteratively tested for
    all stakeholders involved in health decision-making: clinicians,
    researchers, and patients alike. Not only could they improve the
    implementation of known evidence, but the true value of nudging
    could lie in areas where traditional randomized controlled trials
    are lacking, and where clinical equipoise and variation dominate.
    The opportunity to test CDSS nudge alerts and their ability to
    standardize behaviour in the face of uncertainty may generate novel
    insights and improve patient outcomes in areas of clinical practice
    currently without a robust evidence base."

- abstract: "Background:  An Informatics Consult has been proposed in
    which clinicians request novel evidence from large scale health data
    resources, tailored to the treatment of a specific patient. However,
    the availability of such consultations is lacking. We seek to
    provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment
    indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e.,
    anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both
    atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. Methods:  We examined
    four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk
    or all-cause mortality from: (1) randomised controlled trials
    (RCTs), (2) meta-analysis of prior observational studies, (3) trial
    emulation (using population electronic health records
    (N = 3,854,710) and (4) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation).
    We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and
    return of results in electronic health record systems. Results:  We
    found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with AF and
    cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three new sources
    of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational
    studies showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke
    risk (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] = 0.71, CI 0.39--1.29). In a target trial
    emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality
    (HR = 0.61, CI 0.49--0.76) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27, CI
    0.08--0.91). Mendelian randomisation served as a drug target
    validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1 (warfarin
    is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A
    pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed
    that 85% of clinicians found information on prognosis useful and
    that 79% thought that they should have access to the Informatics
    Consult as a service within their healthcare systems. We identified
    candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to
    accelerate the return of results. Conclusion:  We performed a
    proof-of-concept Informatics Consult for evidence generation, which
    may inform treatment decisions in situations where there is dearth
    of randomised trials. Patients are surprised to know that their"

- abstract: "Postoperative critical care is a ﬁnite resource that is
    recommended for high-risk patients. Despite national recommendations
    specifying that such patients should receive postoperative critical
    care, there is evidence that these recommendations are not
    universally followed. We performed a national survey aiming to
    better understand how patients are risk-stratiﬁed in practice;
    elucidate clinicians' opinions about how patients should be selected
    for critical care; and determine factors which affect the actual
    provision of postoperative critical care. As part of the second
    Sprint National Anaesthesia Project, epidemiology of critical care
    after surgery study, we distributed a paper survey to anaesthetists,
    surgeons and intensivists providing peri-operative care during a
    single week in March 2017. We collected data on respondent
    characteristics, and their opinions of postoperative critical care
    provision, potential beneﬁts and real-world challenges. We undertook
    both quantitative and qualitative analyses to interpret the
    responses. We received 10,383 survey responses from 237 hospitals
    across the UK. Consultants used a lower threshold for critical care
    admission than other career grades, indicating potentially more
    risk-averse behaviour. The majority of respondents reported that
    critical care provision was inadequate, and cited the value of
    critical care as being predominantly due to higher nurse: patient
    ratios. Use of objective risk assessment tools was poor, and
    patients were commonly selected for critical care based on
    procedure-speciﬁc pathways rather than individualised risk
    assessment. Challenges were highlighted in the delivery of
    peri-operative critical care services, such as an overall lack of
    capacity, competition for beds with non-surgical cases and poor ﬂow
    through the hospital leading to bed 'blockages'. Critical care is
    perceived to provide beneﬁt to high-risk surgical patients, but
    there is variation in practice about the deﬁnition and determination
    of risk, how patients are referred and how to deal with the lack of
    critical care resources. Future work should focus on evaluating
    'enhanced care' units for postoperative patients, how to better
    implement individualised risk assessment in practice, and how to
    improve patient ﬂow through hospitals."

- abstract: A 40-year-old man with no cardiac history presented with
    central chest pain 8 days after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCov-19
    vaccine against COVID-19. Initial blood tests demonstrated a
    thrombocytopaenia (24×109 μg/L) and a raised d-dimer (\>110 000
    μg/L), and he was urgently transferred to our tertiary referral
    central for suspected vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopaenia and
    thrombosis (VITT). He developed dynamic ischaemic
    electrocardiographic changes with ST elevation, a troponin of 3185
    ng/L, and regional wall motion abnormalities. An occlusion of his
    left anterior descending coronary artery was seen on CT coronary
    angiography. His platelet factor-4 (PF-4) antibody returned strongly
    positive. He was urgently treated for presumed VITT with intravenous
    immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and plasma exchange, but remained
    thrombocytopaenic and was initiated on rituximab. Argatroban was
    used for anticoagulation for his myocardial infarction while he
    remained thrombocytopaenic. After 6 days, his platelet count
    improved, and his PF-4 antibody level, troponin and d-dimer fell. He
    was successfully discharged after 14 days.

- abstract: Graphical models have emerged as a tool to map out the
    interplay between multiple measured and unmeasured variables, and
    can help strengthen the case for a causal association between
    exposures and outcomes in observational studies. In Part 1 of this
    methods series, we will introduce the reader to graphical models for
    causal inference in perioperative medicine, and set the framework
    for Part 2 of the series involving advanced methods for causal
    inference.

- abstract: "Although RCTs represent the gold standard in clinical
    research, most clinical questions cannot be answered using this
    technique, because of ethical considerations, time, and cost. The
    goal of observational research in clinical medicine is to gain
    insight into the relationship between a clinical exposure and
    patient outcome, in the absence of evidence from RCTs. Observational
    research offers additional beneﬁt when compared with data from RCTs:
    the conclusions are often more generalisable to a heterogenous
    population, which may be of greater value to everyday clinical
    practice. In Part 2 of this methods series, we will introduce the
    reader to several advanced methods for supporting the case for
    causality between an exposure and outcome, including: mediation
    analysis, natural experiments, and joint effects methods."

- abstract: Instrumental variable methods, subject to appropriate
    identiﬁcation assumptions, enable consistent estimation of causal
    effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. Near--far
    matching has been proposed as one analytic method to improve
    inference by strengthening the effect of the instrument on the
    exposure and balancing observable characteristics between groups of
    subjects with low and high values of the instrument. However, in
    settings with hierarchical data (e.g. patients nested within
    hospitals), or where several covariate interactions must be
    balanced, conventional near--far matching algorithms may fail to
    achieve the requisite covariate balance. We develop a new matching
    algorithm, that combines near--far matching with reﬁned covariate
    balance, to balance large numbers of nominal covariates while also
    strengthening the instrumental variable. This extension of near--far
    matching is motivated by a case-study that aims to identify the
    causal effect of prompt admission to an intensive care unit on 7-day
    and 28-day mortality.

- abstract: "Purpose: Septic shock is associated with massive release of
    endogenous catecholamines. Adrenergic agents may exacerbate
    catecholamine toxicity and contribute to poor outcomes. We sought to
    determine whether an association existed between tachycardia and
    mortality in septic shock patients requiring norepinephrine for more
    than 6 h despite adequate volume resuscitation. Materials and
    methods: Multicentre retrospective observational study on 730 adult
    patients in septic shock consecutively admitted to eight European
    ICUs between 2011 and 2013. Three timepoints were selected: T1 (ﬁrst
    hour of infusion of norepinephrine), Tpeak (time of highest dose
    during the ﬁrst 24 h of treatment), and T24 (24-h post-T1). Binary
    logistic regression models were constructed for the three
    time-points. Results: Overall ICU mortality was 38.4%. Mortality was
    higher in those requiring high-dose (≥0.3 mcg/kg/min) versus
    low-dose (b0.3 mcg/kg/min) norepinephrine at T1 (53.4% vs 30.6%; p b
    0.001) and T24 (61.4% vs 20.4%; p b 0.0001). Patients requiring
    high-dose with concurrent tachycardia had higher mortality at T1; in
    the lowdose group tachycardia was not associated with mortality.
    Resolving tachycardia (from T1 to T24) was associated with lower
    mortality compared to patients where tachycardia persisted (27.8% vs
    46.4%; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Use of high-dose norepinephrine and
    concurrent tachycardia are associated with poor outcomes in septic
    shock."

- abstract: Pretreatment selection or censoring ("selection on
    treatment") can occur when two treatment levels are compared
    ignoring the third option of neither treatment, in "censoring by
    death" settings where treatment is only defined for those who
    survive long enough to receive it, or in general in studies where
    the treatment is only defined for a subset of the population.
    Unfortunately, the standard instrumental variable (IV) estimand is
    not defined in the presence of such selection, so we consider
    estimating a new survivor-complier causal effect. Although this
    effect is generally not identified under standard IV assumptions, it
    is possible to construct sharp bounds. We derive these bounds and
    give a corresponding data-driven sensitivity analysis, along with
    nonparametric yet efficient estimation methods. Importantly, our
    approach allows for high-dimensional confounding adjustment, and
    valid inference even after employing machine learning. Incorporating
    covariates can tighten bounds dramatically, especially when they are
    strong predictors of the selection process. We apply the methods in
    a UK cohort study of critical care patients to examine the mortality
    effects of prompt admission to the intensive care unit, using ICU
    bed availability as an instrument. Supplementary materials for this
    article are available online.

- abstract: "Background: Instrumental variable (IV) analysis can
    estimate treatment effects in the presence of residual or unmeasured
    confounding. In settings wherein measures of baseline risk severity
    are unavailable, IV designs are, therefore, particularly appealing,
    but, where established measures of risk severity are available, it
    is unclear whether IV methods are preferable. Objective: We compared
    regression with an IV design to estimate the effect of intensive
    care unit (ICU) transfer on mortality in a study with
    well-established measures of risk severity. Research Design: We use
    ICU bed availability at the time of assessment for ICU transfer as
    an instrument. Bed availability increases the chance of ICU
    admission, contains little information about patient
    characteristics, and it is unlikely that bed availability has any
    direct effect on in-hospital mortality. Subjects: We used a cohort
    study of deteriorating ward patients assessed for critical care unit
    admission, in 49 UK National Health Service hospitals between
    November 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011. Measures: Detailed
    demographic, physiological, and comorbidity data were collected for
    all patients. Results: The risk adjustment methods reported that,
    after controlling for all measured covariates including measures of
    risk severity, ICU transfer was associated with higher 28-day
    mortality, with a risk difference of 7.2% (95% conﬁdence interval =
    5.3%--9.1%). The IV estimate of ICU transfer was −5.4% (95%
    conﬁdence interval = −47.1% to 36.3%) and applies to the subsample
    of patients whose transfer was \"encouraged\" by bed availability.
    Conclusions: IV estimates indicate that ICU care is beneﬁcial but
    are imprecisely estimated. Risk-adjusted estimates are more precise"

- abstract: "Background: Cancellation of planned surgery impacts
    substantially on patients and health systems. This study describes
    the incidence and reasons for cancellation of inpatient surgery in
    the UK NHS. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort
    study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017 in 245 NHS hospitals.
    Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical cancellations were
    recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we identiﬁed
    patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation due
    to inadequate bed capacity. Results: We analysed data from 14 936
    patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients
    (10.0%) reported previous cancellation for the same procedure;
    contemporaneous hospital census data indicated that 13.9% patients
    attending inpatient operations were cancelled on the day of surgery.
    Non-clinical reasons, predominantly inadequate bed capacity,
    accounted for a large proportion of previous cancellations.
    Independent risk factors for cancellation due to inadequate bed
    capacity included requirement for postoperative critical care \\[odds
    ratio (OR)¼2.92; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 2.12e4.02; P\\<0.001\\]
    and the presence of an emergency department in the treating hospital
    (OR¼4.18; 95% CI, 2.22e7.89; P\\<0.001). Patients undergoing cancer
    surgery (OR¼0.32; 95% CI, 0.22e0.46; P\\<0.001), obstetric procedures
    (OR¼0.17; 95% CI, 0.08e0.32; P\\<0.001), and expedited surgery
    (OR¼0.39; 95% CI, 0.27e0.56; P\\<0.001) were less likely to be
    cancelled."
