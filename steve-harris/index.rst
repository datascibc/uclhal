I am a Critical Care physician. My clinical training included anaesthesia and tropical medicine, and I worked for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti. In 2009, I won a Wellcome Clinical Research Training Fellowship. This funded the largest prospective cohort study of deteriorating ward patients in the NHS jointly run from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC). We showed that decision making around the time of referral to critical care is variable, and constrained by bed availability.

I was awarded my PhD from LSHTM in 2014, and became an National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Lecturer at University College London (UCL) before being appointed as a Consultant in Critical Care at University College Hospital London (UCLH) in 2016. I now lead the software development for the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative Critical Care theme in which we have developed the first multi-centre research database for critical care (around 40 000 patients and 50 million unique data points per year).

In 2016, I became an Improvement Science Fellow for the Health Foundation, and began building a live data analytics platform (EMAP) for UCLH supported from UCLH Charity. And in 2020, I won funding from NHS-X to build a Hyperlocal ward forecasting system.
