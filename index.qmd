::: {.lead}
  We work on translational data science for [critical care]{.fw-bolder} and related specialties. We bring together four interrelated disciplines within the lab:

  1. Learning Healthcare Systems via nudge randomisation
  2. Algorithm stewardship and real world / real time decision support
  3. Collaborative data science and national level epidemiology
  4. Novel Non-Invasive Physiological Measurements and Assistance

### Students

Undergraduate students work as **research assistants**, learning about the scientific method and assisting in the collection and processing of research data. Research assistants attend weekly lab meetings and can expect a **letter of recommendation** describing their work in and contributions to the lab (please give one month of advanced notice). Opportunities to earn **co-authorship** on research products (e.g., conference presentations) are also occasionally offered to advanced research assistants.
