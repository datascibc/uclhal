This means that we don’t rely on just the ‘safety’ of the data but also take into account the following:\n\n\n\nall individuals have substantive contracts or educational relationships with higher education or NHS institutions\nthose working need to have evidence of experience of working with such data (e.g. previous training, previous work with ONS, data safe havens etc.) or they need a supervisor who can has similar experience\nthose working need to undergo training in information governance and issues with statistical disclosure control (SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\nprojects must ‘serve the public good’\nprojects must meet relevant HRA and UCLH research and ethics approvals\nservice delivery work mandated as per usual trust processes\n\n\n\n\n\nworking at UCLH in the NHS on approved infrastructure\nUCLH local and remote desktops\nUCLH Data Science Desktop\nGeneric Application Development Environment (GADE)\n\n\n\n\n\noutputs (e.g. reports, figures and tables) must be non-disclosing\noutputs should remain on NHS systems initially\na copy of all outputs that are released externally (documents) should be stored in one central location so that there is visibility for all\n\n\n\n\n\ndirect identifiers (hospital numbers, NHS numbers, names etc) should be masked unless there is an explicit justification for their use\ndata releases are proportionate (e.g. limited by calendar periods, by patient cohort etc.)\nfurther work to obscure or mask the data is not necessary given the other safe guards (as per the recommendation by the UK data service)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of this content is derived and adapted from the Safe Data Access Professional’s Working group, and we strongly recommend reviewing their handbook]\n\n\n\n\n\nPractically although this means that we are judging your data safety on more than just the qualities of the data, we are able to work with data that would otherwise be considered unsafe. The plot below demonstrates this by comparing the effort we would have to expend on safety if we wanted to release data on the internet. This means that we lose all the other 4 safes.\n\n\n\nSafety through disclosure control alone is much harder than using the other 4 ‘safes’"

    "text": "What is the ‘Data Clinic’?\nThe Data Clinic is a Quality Improvement initiative to help frontline healthcare workers in Critical Care get data from EPIC.\nThis is to improve the ease and speed of audits, QIPs and service evaluations we perform in Critical Care.\n\n\nWhat are the issues that the Data Clinic is trying to solve?\nUCLH has invested millons of pounds to obtain an fully electronic health record system (EHRS) in the form of EPIC since 2019. It aims to be a leader in the field of technologically-enabled healthcare.\nThe current method for obtaining data from EPIC is through contacting the Buisness Intelligence (BI) team, whose role it is to monitor performance data in their department and service data requests. This has a number of issues:\n - Many clinical staff are unaware of who the BI team are or what they do \n - The current process of requesting data often takes the form of numerous back-and-forth emails between clinical staff and the BI team, clarifying what data is required vs what is possible to extract. This process is often time-consuming and frustrating for both the clinical staff and BI team. \n - Although the BI team have a good understanding of how to find data in Epic and manage it, sometimes they lack the clinical understanding and direction to provide learning from it. \nThe Data Clinic aims to improve the process of providing data to clinical staff using two approaches:\n 1. We aim to understand the clinical question the requestor is trying to answer and, with our knowledge of the data that is available, clarify exactly what data is required for their project.\n 2. Then we work with the BI team to provide that data for the requestor as quickly as possible, in the form that the requestor needs.\nWe hypothesise that this shall benefit both clinical staff and the BI team.\n Clinical staff: \n - makes the process of getting data from EPIC clearer\n - enhances understanding of the data that is available from EPIC \n - help with analysis of data (if required)\n - easier to get the data needed to complete audit/QIP/service evaluations (thereby increasing the number of projects completed and improving patient care)\n\n BI team:\n - Saves time/frustration emailing back-and-forth with clinical staff   \n - Better understanding of clinical relevance of their work (through feedback on the results of QI projects)\n\n\n(Current) Structure of the Data Clinic\nBelow is a brief, introductory overview of the current stucture of the Data Clinic. A more in-depth overview can be found in the Data Clinic Teams channel.\nRequests for data can currently come from 2 channels:\n\nA referral from the Audit/QI clinic (where a project has indicated that they need EPIC data to complete their project)\nA direct email to the Data Clinic email address or one of the members of the Data Clinic team.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, all audit/QIP should go through the Audit/QI clinic prior to being referred to the Data Clinic. This allows the Audit/QIP team to register the project, keep track of it and provide methodological support prior to the Data Clinic. Other data requests that are not audit/QI (e.g. service evaluation) are more likely to come through the second route.\nOnce a request has been recieved, a Data Fellow meets with the requestor to discuss their project and the data requirements.\nFollowing this, the Data Fellow shall meet with the BI team to perform a 1st extraction of the data. This shall be shown to the requestor.\nIf they are happy with this data, we then proceed to a full data extraction and delivery. If they are not satisfied, the extraction is revised and further meeting are arranged with the requestor until the data provided is adaquate (see Figure 1 for a diagram of this)\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA(Data request recieved) --- B(1st Meeting between requestor & Data Fellow)\nB --- C(Meeting between Data Fellow and BI team)\nC --- D[1st extraction of data]\nD --- F{2nd meeting between requestor & Data Fellow}\nF --- G[Happy with data]\nF --- H[Revisions needed]\nG --- I(Full extraction & data delivered)\nH --- J(Further revision to extraction)\nJ --- F\n\nlinkStyle default stroke: white;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Data Clinic is being run as a QIP, this process is subject to change over time.\n\n\nRelevant People\n\nData Clinic\nDr Tim Bonnici: Data Lead for Critical Care (t.bonnici@nhs.net)\nData Fellows: Change yearly, previous fellows are listed below\n\n2021/22: Conor Foley, Dan Stein\n2022/23: Ruaraidh Campbell, Sarah Vaughan, Hrisheekesh Vaidya\n\n\n\nBI team\nTracey Crissell: Critical BI team lead (traceycrissell@nhs.net)\nHumayra Chowdhury: BI analyst (humayra.chowdhury@nhs.net)\nThe Data Clinic also works closely with the Audit/QI team and the Methodology Clinic team\n\n\nAudit/QI team\nVeronica (‘Ronnie’) Marsh: Audit/QI lead (veronica.marsh1@nhs.net)\n\n\nMethodology team\nSiri Steinmo: Quality Improvement Lead (siri.steinmo@nhs.net)\nPetra Voegele: PERRT nurse, Methodology clinic co-lead (petra.voegele@nhs.net)\n\n\n\nOnboarding information\nThis page will have given you a good general oversight of the Data Clinic and the people involved.\nHowever, if you are going to be working with the Data Clinic team, then you shall require some further information/orientation.\nBelow is a checklist of items to arrange to get up-and-running with the Data Clinic:\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic Teams channel (contains more detailed information of structure of Data clinic, training on how to extract data from EPIC, a tracker for projects currently going through Data Clinic, records of previous projects)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nRead through the comprehensive “Data Clinic Handover Document” & watch the video tour of the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic GitHub repository (contains code for extracting data from EPIC)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nObtain access to Caboodle (EPIC’s main reporting database). Allows you to extract EPIC data.\n\nEmail David Thomson (Information Services Manager) to obtain (david.thompson19@nhs.net). You shall need to attend a mandatory training session with David before being given access\n\nComplete Caboodle training via EpicUserWeb\n\nTo sign up for an EpicUserWeb account, visit https://userweb.epic.com/Account/Register\n\nThere is a lot of training resources for using EPIC on EpicUserWeb, most of which is not relevant to the Data Clinic. The key learning to look at can be found in the “Recommended Reading List.docx” file, within the EPIC training folder in the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nComplete SQL learning (SQL is the coding language used for extracting data from reporting databases, such as Caboodle)\n\nThere are a number of free vs paid learning reserouces for this.\nPrevious Data Fellows have bought a subscription to DataCamp. This is paid for, however it is good for learning and also has other coding languages (e.g. python, R)\n\nThere are free learning resources in the “Data Science learning resources” folder within the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nIntroduce yourself to Ronnie, Siri & Petra from the Audit/QI and Methodology teams\n\nYou will work closely with them throughout the year. It is good to meet up with them so they can show you what they do in the Audit/QI & Methodology clinics and how this relates to the Data Clinic\n\nGet access to the Data Clinic email inbox\n\nEmail Tim Bonnici to obtain\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Progress of Project\n2021/22\n\n\nStart of project\n\nBackground to project including issues we hoped to address laid out in project overview document (see Notion document on Teams channel)\n\nSurvey done on 33 staff members in Critical Care that identified barriers to using data to complete audit/QI projects\n\n7/8 projects served through Data Clinic, including audit/QI/project feasibility projects.\n\nDraft project tracker set up to record length of time taken to serve data for data requests\n\nQualitative feedback on the Data Clinic process gathered from joint meetings between Data lead/Data Fellows/BI team\n\nAdjustments made to running of the Data Clinic from this feedback including identifying the need for Audit/Methodology support for some projects before they attend Data Clinic, to clarify the aims and scope of projects.\n\nOverall, provided qualitative evidence that the Data Clinic initiative was feasible, beneficial to BI team and could help clinical staff.\n\n\n2022/23\n\n\nPlan for the year was to formalise the measurement of the Data Clinic outcomes, with a view to future publication\n\nData Clinic email address and Teams channel set up, to create central repositiory for Data Clinic items. Github set up for code repository.\n\nAudit/QI clinic & Methodology clinic set up. Process of referring projects from these clinics to Data Clinic set up."

    "text": "Getting data in near real time offers profound benefits for everything from clinical decisions about individual patients to resource management across entire hospitals. A multidisciplinary team from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) spent two years developing the Experimental Medicine Application Platform (EMAP) platform to make fuller, faster, more effective use of data in electronic health records (EHRs).\nThe COVID pandemic saw them demonstrate the quality of the platform and the team. Using the EMAP infrastructure they rapidly created a bed management tool that helped take pressure off north London intensive care units (ICUs). Now the team has facilitated a series of grants to take their work into new areas including better antibiotic stewardship."

    "text": "Outstanding achievements\nWhen COVID cases surged the EMAP team, co-led by UCLH critical care consultant Dr Steve Harris, responded with a bed management tool that reported in near real time. This allowed staff to be allocated where they were most needed and kept transfer beds available at all times. The tool supported the treatment of 434 critically ill patients (including retrieving 162 patients to the UCHL surge centre) from overstretched units across north London."
