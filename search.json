This is no longer because of poor adoption of Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS), but because ML4H needs an infrastructure for development, deployment and evaluation within the healthcare institution. In this paper, we propose a design pattern called a Clinical Deployment Environment (CDE). We sketch the five pillars of the CDE: (1) real world development supported by live data where ML4H teams can iteratively build and test at the bedside (2) an ML-Ops platform that brings the rigour and standards of continuous deployment to ML4H (3) design and supervision by those with expertise in AI safety (4) the methods of implementation science that enable the algorithmic insights to influence the behaviour of clinicians and patients and (5) continuous evaluation that uses randomisation to avoid bias but in an agile manner. The CDE is intended to answer the same requirements that bio-medicine articulated in establishing the translational medicine domain. It envisions a transition from “real-world” data to “real-world” development.\n    \n    \n       2022 \n        British Journal of Anaesthesia  \n      Wilson M, Asselbergs F, Harris S\n      Learning from individualised variation for evidence generation within a learning health system\n    \n    \n       2022 \n        npj Digital Medicine  \n      King Z, Farrington J, Utley M, Kung E, Elkhodair S, Harris S, Sekula R, Gillham J, Li K, Crowe S\n      Machine learning for real-time aggregated prediction of hospital admission for emergency patients\n      Machine learning for hospital operations is under-studied. We present a prediction pipeline that uses live electronic health-records for patients in a UK teaching hospital’s emergency department (ED) to generate short-term, probabilistic forecasts of emergency admissions. A set of XGBoost classifiers applied to 109,465 ED visits yielded AUROCs from 0.82 to 0.90 depending on elapsed visit-time at the point of prediction. Patient-level probabilities of admission were aggregated to forecast the number of admissions among current ED patients and, incorporating patients yet to arrive, total emergency admissions within specified time-windows. The pipeline gave a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.0 admissions (mean percentage error of 17%) versus 6.5 (32%) for a benchmark metric. Models developed with 104,504 later visits during the Covid-19 pandemic gave AUROCs of 0.68–0.90 and MAE of 4.2 (30%) versus a 4.9 (33%) benchmark.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.\n    \n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving and maintaining normal sub-lingual blood flow in small ( 20um) vessels, termed as microcirculation, is essential for critically ill intensive care patients since this is where the delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues occurs. However, historically, most clinical trials & treatments have focused on blood flow in the larger blood vessels (macrocirculation), largely due to the greater ease with which this can be practically measured. Technological advances have enabled video recordings of the sub-lingual microcirculation (i.e. from under the tongue) to be obtained using darkfield microscopy (DFM). However, the difficulties in analysing these videos has hindered the uptake and utilisation of this imaging modality. Currently, these short video sequences are analysed mostly by hand, to quantify the vessel density and flow within vessels within the field of view. The manual analysis and vessel segmentation is an extremely labour intensive procedure, which can take up to one hour to score a single video [12].\nThis challenge aimed to establish whether a single validated measure of microcirculatory perfusion (microcirculatory flow index) can be predicted directly from a DFM video sequence, without intermediate manual analysis steps. Automatic analysis that can be carried out in (near) real-time would facilitate the incorporation of microcirulatory targets into clinical trials by enabling the impact of interventions to be quantified and enacted upon with the aim of optimising the microcirculation and improving patient outcomes."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction The benefits of lung protective ventilation have been replicated in multiple trials.1,2 However, we suspected that adherence to this standard of care remained poor. Using the NIHR critical care Health Informatics Collaborative (ccHIC) database, we analysed data from 11 teaching hospital intensive care units (22-524 patient episodes) to investigate real-world clinical practice.\nMethods 1248 patient episodes, where ventilation was continued for ≥48-hours, with 232,600 hours of concurrent mechanical ventilation and blood gas data were identified as suitable for analysis. Short gaps in ventilation (<6 hours) were imputed based on the median of nearest known values, and only the single longest period of ventilation from each patient episode was analysed.\nResults The median tidal volume received by patients was 7.3 ml/kg-1 PBW (IQR:5.7–8.8). Female patients, especially those with higher BMI (≥30 kgm-2) consistently received higher tidal volumes than males. Patients with severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13kPa) received a median tidal volume of 7.1 ml/kg-1 PBW, and had 71% ICU mortality (Table 1). Patients with respiratory failure sufficient to qualify for recruitment into recent clinical trials (PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa with PEEP ≥5 cm/H20), who were exposed to tidal volumes≥12 ml/kg-1 PBW for longer than two hours had significantly increased risk of ICU mortality (odds ratio=2.89 [1.25–7.2]; p=0.007); This was not observed for patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa (odds ratio=0.95 [0.58–1.56], p=0.91).\nConclusions More than 15 years after the ARMA study1 demonstrated a mortality benefit from lung protective ventilation, we are still not implementing 6 ml/kg-1 PBW ventilation into clinical practice, and are exposing even patients with a severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13 kPa) to higher than recommended tidal volumes, with females and higher BMI patients at particular risk. We have also demonstrated that failure to institute lung protective ventilation in patients with a PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa leads to increased ICU mortality, which is not present in patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa."

This study describes ethnicity data in nation-wide electronic health records in England, UK.\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified person-level records for the England population available in the National Health Service (NHS) Digital trusted research environment. Primary care records (GDPPR) were linked to hospital and national mortality records. We assessed completeness, consistency, and granularity of ethnicity records using all available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity and NHS ethnicity categories.\nFindings\nFrom 61.8 million individuals registered with a primary care practice in England, 51.5 (83.3%) had at least one ethnicity record in GDPPR, increasing to 93·9% when linked with hospital records. Approximately 12·0% had at least two conflicting ethnicity codes in primary care records. Women were more likely to have ethnicity recorded than men. Ethnicity was missing most frequently in individuals from 18 to 39 years old and in the southern regions of England. Individuals with an ethnicity record had more comorbidities recorded than those without. Of 489 SNOMED-CT ethnicity concepts available, 255 were used in primary care records. Discrepancies between SNOMED-CT and NHS ethnicity categories were observed, specifically within “Other-” ethnicity groups.\nInterpretation\nMore than 250 ethnicity sub-groups may be found in health records for the English population, although commonly categorised into “White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Mixed”, and “Other”. One in ten individuals do not have ethnicity information recorded in primary care or hospital records. SNOMED-CT codes represent more diversity in ethnicity groups than the NHS ethnicity classification. Improved recording of self-reported ethnicity at first point-of-care and consistency in ethnicity classification across healthcare settings can potentially improve the accuracy of ethnicity in research and ultimately care for all ethnicities.\nFunding\nBritish Heart Foundation Data Science Centre led by Health Data Research UK."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMany routinely administered treatments lack evidence as to their effectiveness. When treatments lack evidence, patients receive varying care based on the preferences of clinicians. Standard randomised controlled trials are unsuited to comparisons of different routine treatment strategies, and there remains little economic incentive for change. Integrating clinical trial infrastructure into electronic health record systems offers the potential for routine treatment comparisons at scale, through reduced trial costs. To date, embedded trials have automated data collection, participant identification and eligibility screening, but randomisation and consent remain manual and therefore costly tasks. This study will investigate the feasibility of using computer prompts to allow flexible randomisation at the point of clinical decision making. It will compare the effectiveness of two prompt designs through the lens of a candidate research question—comparing liberal or restrictive magnesium supplementation practices for critical care patients. It will also explore the acceptability of two consent models for conducting comparative effectiveness research.\nWe will conduct a single centre, mixed-methods feasibility study, aiming to recruit 50 patients undergoing elective surgery requiring postoperative critical care admission. Participants will be randomised to either ‘Nudge’ or ‘Preference’ designs of electronic point-of-care randomisation prompt, and liberal or restrictive magnesium supplementation. We will judge feasibility through a combination of study outcomes. The primary outcome will be the proportion of prompts displayed resulting in successful randomisation events (compliance with the allocated magnesium strategy). Secondary outcomes will evaluate the acceptability of both prompt designs to clinicians and ascertain the acceptability of preemptive and opt-out consent models to patients.\nThis study was approved by Riverside Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 21/ LO/0785) and will be published on completion.

    "text": "Abstract\nAbstract: Introduction Hospitals are complex systems and optimising their function is critical to the provision of high quality, cost effective healthcare. Metrics of performance have to date focused on the performance of individual elements rather than the whole system. Manipulation of individual elements of a complex system without an integrative understanding of its function is undesirable and may lead to counterintuitive outcomes and a holistic metric of hospital function might help design more efficient services.\nObjectives: We aimed to use network analysis to characterise the structure of the system of perioperative care for emergency surgical admissions in our tertiary care hospital.\nDesign: We constructed a weighted directional network representation of the emergency surgical services using patient location data from electronic health records.\nSetting: A single-centre tertiary care hospital in the UK.\nParticipants: We selected data from the retrospective electronic health record data of all unplanned admissions with a surgical intervention during their stay during a 3.5-year period, which resulted in a set of 16 500 individual admissions.\nMethods: We then constructed and analysed the structure of this network using established methods from network science such as degree distribution, betweenness centrality and small-world characteristics.\nResults: The analysis showed the service to be a complex system with scale-free, small-world network properties. We also identified such potential hubs and bottlenecks in the system.\nConclusions: Our holistic, system-wide description of a hospital service may provide tools to inform service improvement initiatives and gives us insights into the architecture of a complex system of care. The implications for the structure and resilience of the service is that while being robust in general, the system may be vulnerable to outages at specific key nodes."

We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence.\nParticipants\nAll 12–17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre.\nMain outcome measures\nHospitalisations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12–17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence.\nResults\nAt high future case incidence of 1000/100,000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100,000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and two deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100,000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date.\nConclusions\nGiven the current (as at 15 September 2021) high case rates (680/100,000 population/week in 10–19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAtrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered condition in critical illness and causes adverse effects including haemodynamic decompensation, stroke and prolonged hospital stay. It is a common practice in critical care to supplement serum magnesium for the purpose of preventing episodes of atrial fibrillation. However, no randomised studies support this practice in the non-cardiac surgery critical care population, and the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation is unclear. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in preventing the onset of atrial fibrillation in a mixed critical care population. We conducted a single centre retrospective observational study of adult critical care patients. We utilised a natural experiment design, using the supplementation preference of the bedside critical care nurse as an instrumental variable. Using routinely collected electronic patient data, magnesium supplementation opportunities were defined and linked to the bedside nurse. Nurse preference for administering magnesium was obtained using multilevel modelling. The results were used to define “liberal” and “restrictive” supplementation groups, which were inputted into an instrumental variable regression to obtain an estimate of the effect of magnesium supplementation. 9114 magnesium supplementation opportunities were analysed, representing 2137 critical care admissions for 1914 patients. There was significant variation in magnesium supplementation practices attributable to the individual nurse, after accounting for covariates. The instrumental variable analysis showed magnesium supplementation was associated with a 3% decreased relative risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation event (95% CI −0.06 to −0.004, p=0.03). This study supports the strategy of routine supplementation, but further work is required to identify optimal serum magnesium targets for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis."

    "text": "Abstract\nDelirium, an acute confusional state, is a common occurrence in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Patients who develop delirium have globally worse outcomes than those who do not and thus the diagnosis of delirium is of importance. Current diagnostic methods have several limitations leading to the suggestion of eye-tracking for its diagnosis through in-attention. To ascertain the requirements for an eye-tracking system in an adult ICU, measurements were carried out at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Clinical criteria guided empirical requirements of invasiveness and calibration methods while accuracy and precision were measured. A non-invasive system was then developed utilising a patient-facing RGB camera and a scene-facing RGBD camera. The system’s performance was measured in a replicated laboratory environment with healthy volunteers revealing an accuracy and precision that outperforms what is required while simultaneously being non-invasive and calibration-free The system was then deployed as part of CONfuSED, a clinical feasibility study where we report aggregated data from 5 patients as well as the acceptability of the system to bedside nursing staff. To the best of our knowledge, the system is the first eye-tracking systems to be deployed in an ICU for delirium monitoring."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAbstract: Objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health problem, whose management in low-resource settings is hampered by fragile health systems and lack of access to specialist services. Improvement is complex, given the interaction of multiple people, processes and institutions. We aimed to develop a mixed-method approach to understand the TBI pathway based on the lived experience of local people, supported by quantitative methodologies and to determine potential improvement targets.\nDesign: We describe a systems approach based on narrative exploration, participatory diagramming, data collection and discrete event simulation (DES), conducted by an international research collaborative.\nSetting: The study is set in the tertiary neurotrauma centre in Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar, in 2019–2020 (prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic).\nParticipants: The qualitative work involved 40 workshop participants and 64 interviewees to explore the views of a wide range of stakeholders including staff, patients and relatives. The 1-month retrospective admission snapshot covered 85 surgical neurotrauma admissions.\nResults: The TBI pathway was outlined, with system boundaries defined around the management of TBI once admitted to the neurosurgical unit. Retrospective data showed 18% mortality, 71% discharge to home and an 11% referral rate. DES was used to investigate the system, showing its vulnerability to small surges in patient numbers, with critical points being CT scanning and observation ward beds. This explorative model indicated that a modest expansion of observation ward beds to 30 would remove the flow-limitations and indicated possible consequences of changes.\nConclusions: A systems approach to improving TBI care in resource-poor settings may be supported by simulation and informed by qualitative work to ground it in the direct experience of those involved. Narrative interviews, participatory diagramming and DES represent one possible suite of methods deliverable within an international partnership. Findings can support targeted improvement investments despite coexisting resource limitations while indicating concomitant risks."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nUpdatable estimates of COVID-19 onset, progression, and trajectories underpin pandemic mitigation efforts. To identify and characterise disease trajectories, we aimed to define and validate ten COVID-19 phenotypes from nationwide linked electronic health records (EHR) using an extensible framework.\nMethods\nIn this cohort study, we used eight linked National Health Service (NHS) datasets for people in England alive on Jan 23, 2020. Data on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, primary and secondary care records, and death registrations were collected until Nov 30, 2021. We defined ten COVID-19 phenotypes reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity and encompassing five categories: positive SARS-CoV-2 test, primary care diagnosis, hospital admission, ventilation modality (four phenotypes), and death (three phenotypes). We constructed patient trajectories illustrating transition frequency and duration between phenotypes. Analyses were stratified by pandemic waves and vaccination status. Findings\nAmong 57 032 174 individuals included in the cohort, 13 990 423 COVID-19 events were identified in 7 244 925 individuals, equating to an infection rate of 12·7% during the study period. Of 7 244 925 individuals, 460 737 (6·4%) were admitted to hospital and 158 020 (2·2%) died. Of 460 737 individuals who were admitted to hospital, 48 847 (10·6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 69 090 (15·0%) received non-invasive ventilation, and 25 928 (5·6%) received invasive ventilation. Among 384 135 patients who were admitted to hospital but did not require ventilation, mortality was higher in wave 1 (23 485 [30·4%] of 77 202 patients) than wave 2 (44 220 [23·1%] of 191 528 patients), but remained unchanged for patients admitted to the ICU. Mortality was highest among patients who received ventilatory support outside of the ICU in wave 1 (2569 [50·7%] of 5063 patients). 15 486 (9·8%) of 158 020 COVID-19-related deaths occurred within 28 days of the first COVID-19 event without a COVID-19 diagnoses on the death certificate. 10 884 (6·9%) of 158 020 deaths were identified exclusively from mortality data with no previous COVID-19 phenotype recorded. We observed longer patient trajectories in wave 2 than wave 1. Interpretation\nOur analyses illustrate the wide spectrum of disease trajectories as shown by differences in incidence, survival, and clinical pathways. We have provided a modular analytical framework that can be used to monitor the impact of the pandemic and generate evidence of clinical and policy relevance using multiple EHR sources.

    "text": "Abstract\nBlinking is a useful biological signal that can gate gaze regression models to avoid the use of incorrect data in downstream tasks. Existing datasets are imbalanced both in frequency of class but also in intra-class difficulty which we demonstrate is a barrier for curriculum learning. We thus propose a novel curriculum augmentation scheme that aims to address frequency and difficulty imbalances implicitly which are are terming Curriculum Learning by Augmentation (CLbA).\nUsing Curriculum Learning by Augmentation (CLbA), we achieve a state-of-the-art performance of mean Average Precision (mAP) 0.971 using ResNet-18 up from the previous state-of-the-art of mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.757 using DenseNet-121 whilst outcompeting Curriculum Learning by Bootstrapping (CLbB) by a significant margin with improved calibration. This new training scheme thus allows the use of smaller and more performant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones fulfilling Nyquist criteria to achieve a sampling frequency of 102.3Hz. This paves the way for inference of blinking in real-time applications."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground:\nInfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a prothrombotic state, but long-term effects of COVID-19 on incidence of vascular diseases are unclear.\nMethods:\nWe studied vascular diseases after COVID-19 diagnosis in population-wide anonymized linked English and Welsh electronic health records from January 1 to December 7, 2020. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing the incidence of arterial thromboses and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence in people without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted subgroup analyses by COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and previous history.\nResults:\nAmong 48 million adults, 125 985 were hospitalized and 1 319 789 were not hospitalized within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. In England, there were 260 279 first arterial thromboses and 59 421 first VTEs during 41.6 million person-years of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios for first arterial thrombosis after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with no COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 21.7 (95% CI, 21.0–22.4) in week 1 after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1.34 (95% CI, 1.21–1.48) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios for first VTE after COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 33.2 (95% CI, 31.3–35.2) in week 1 to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.50–2.17) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios were higher, for longer after diagnosis, after hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, among Black or Asian versus White people, and among people without versus with a previous event. The estimated whole-population increases in risk of arterial thromboses and VTEs 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, corresponding to 7200 and 3500 additional events, respectively, after 1.4 million COVID-19 diagnoses.\nConclusions:\nHigh relative incidence of vascular events soon after COVID-19 diagnosis declines more rapidly for arterial thromboses than VTEs. However, incidence remains elevated up to 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. These results support policies to prevent severe COVID-19 by means of COVID-19 vaccines, early review after discharge, risk factor control, and use of secondary preventive agents in high-risk patients."

Within the data science setting I hope to employ quantitative methods from other areas of data science such as network analysis, machine learning and simulation to develop clinically founded models that allow us to understand strain/stress within healthcare systems and effectively target improvement and development in the peri-operative care.\nSome of my recent work published in a variety of journals:\nMulti-centre, international study on COVID-19 patients and the effects of treatment on the development of secondary infections\nSystems approach to improving traumatic brain injury care in Myanmar: a mixed-methods study from lived experience to discrete event simulation\nUse of network analysis to model the effects of the SARS Cov2 pandemic on acute patient care within a healthcare system\nNetwork science to investigate the structure of a complex healthcare system - a network analysis using data from emergency surgical services\nComputational model of cerebral oxygenation after traumatic brain injury and the implications for Rescuing Hypoxic Tissue"

The plot below demonstrates this by comparing the effort we would have to expend on safety if we wanted to release data on the internet.

    "text": "What is the ‘Data Clinic’?\nThe Data Clinic is a Quality Improvement initiative to help frontline healthcare workers in Critical Care get data from EPIC.\nThis is to improve the ease and speed of audits, QIPs and service evaluations we perform in Critical Care.\n\n\nWhat are the issues that the Data Clinic is trying to solve?\nUCLH has invested millons of pounds to obtain an fully electronic health record system (EHRS) in the form of EPIC since 2019. It aims to be a leader in the field of technologically-enabled healthcare.\nThe current method for obtaining data from EPIC is through contacting the Buisness Intelligence (BI) team, whose role it is to monitor performance data in their department and service data requests. This has a number of issues:\n - Many clinical staff are unaware of who the BI team are or what they do \n - The current process of requesting data often takes the form of numerous back-and-forth emails between clinical staff and the BI team, clarifying what data is required vs what is possible to extract. This process is often time-consuming and frustrating for both the clinical staff and BI team. \n - Although the BI team have a good understanding of how to find data in Epic and manage it, sometimes they lack the clinical understanding and direction to provide learning from it. \nThe Data Clinic aims to improve the process of providing data to clinical staff using two approaches:\n 1. We aim to understand the clinical question the requestor is trying to answer and, with our knowledge of the data that is available, clarify exactly what data is required for their project.\n 2. Then we work with the BI team to provide that data for the requestor as quickly as possible, in the form that the requestor needs.\nWe hypothesise that this shall benefit both clinical staff and the BI team.\n Clinical staff: \n - makes the process of getting data from EPIC clearer\n - enhances understanding of the data that is available from EPIC \n - help with analysis of data (if required)\n - easier to get the data needed to complete audit/QIP/service evaluations (thereby increasing the number of projects completed and improving patient care)\n\n BI team:\n - Saves time/frustration emailing back-and-forth with clinical staff   \n - Better understanding of clinical relevance of their work (through feedback on the results of QI projects)\n\n\n(Current) Structure of the Data Clinic\nBelow is a brief, introductory overview of the current stucture of the Data Clinic. A more in-depth overview can be found in the Data Clinic Teams channel.\nRequests for data can currently come from 2 channels:\n\nA referral from the Audit/QI clinic (where a project has indicated that they need EPIC data to complete their project)\nA direct email to the Data Clinic email address or one of the members of the Data Clinic team.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, all audit/QIP should go through the Audit/QI clinic prior to being referred to the Data Clinic. This allows the Audit/QIP team to register the project, keep track of it and provide methodological support prior to the Data Clinic. Other data requests that are not audit/QI (e.g. service evaluation) are more likely to come through the second route.\nOnce a request has been recieved, a Data Fellow meets with the requestor to discuss their project and the data requirements.\nFollowing this, the Data Fellow shall meet with the BI team to perform a 1st extraction of the data. This shall be shown to the requestor.\nIf they are happy with this data, we then proceed to a full data extraction and delivery. If they are not satisfied, the extraction is revised and further meeting are arranged with the requestor until the data provided is adaquate (see Figure 1 for a diagram of this)\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA(Data request recieved) --- B(1st Meeting between requestor & Data Fellow)\nB --- C(Meeting between Data Fellow and BI team)\nC --- D[1st extraction of data]\nD --- F{2nd meeting between requestor & Data Fellow}\nF --- G[Happy with data]\nF --- H[Revisions needed]\nG --- I(Full extraction & data delivered)\nH --- J(Further revision to extraction)\nJ --- F\n\nlinkStyle default stroke: white;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Data Clinic is being run as a QIP, this process is subject to change over time.\n\n\nRelevant People\n\nData Clinic\nDr Tim Bonnici: Data Lead for Critical Care (t.bonnici@nhs.net)\nData Fellows: Change yearly, previous fellows are listed below\n\n2021/22: Conor Foley, Dan Stein\n2022/23: Ruaraidh Campbell, Sarah Vaughan, Hrisheekesh Vaidya\n\n\n\nBI team\nTracey Crissell: Critical BI team lead (traceycrissell@nhs.net)\nHumayra Chowdhury: BI analyst (humayra.chowdhury@nhs.net)\nThe Data Clinic also works closely with the Audit/QI team and the Methodology Clinic team\n\n\nAudit/QI team\nVeronica (‘Ronnie’) Marsh: Audit/QI lead (veronica.marsh1@nhs.net)\n\n\nMethodology team\nSiri Steinmo: Quality Improvement Lead (siri.steinmo@nhs.net)\nPetra Voegele: PERRT nurse, Methodology clinic co-lead (petra.voegele@nhs.net)\n\n\n\nOnboarding information\nThis page will have given you a good general oversight of the Data Clinic and the people involved.\nHowever, if you are going to be working with the Data Clinic team, then you shall require some further information/orientation.\nBelow is a checklist of items to arrange to get up-and-running with the Data Clinic:\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic Teams channel (contains more detailed information of structure of Data clinic, training on how to extract data from EPIC, a tracker for projects currently going through Data Clinic, records of previous projects)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nRead through the comprehensive “Data Clinic Handover Document” & watch the video tour of the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nObtain access to the Data Clinic GitHub repository (contains code for extracting data from EPIC)\n\nEmail Tim Bonicci to obtain\n\nObtain access to Caboodle (EPIC’s main reporting database). Allows you to extract EPIC data.\n\nEmail David Thomson (Information Services Manager) to obtain (david.thompson19@nhs.net). You shall need to attend a mandatory training session with David before being given access\n\nComplete Caboodle training via EpicUserWeb\n\nTo sign up for an EpicUserWeb account, visit https://userweb.epic.com/Account/Register\n\nThere is a lot of training resources for using EPIC on EpicUserWeb, most of which is not relevant to the Data Clinic. The key learning to look at can be found in the “Recommended Reading List.docx” file, within the EPIC training folder in the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nComplete SQL learning (SQL is the coding language used for extracting data from reporting databases, such as Caboodle)\n\nThere are a number of free vs paid learning reserouces for this.\nPrevious Data Fellows have bought a subscription to DataCamp. This is paid for, however it is good for learning and also has other coding languages (e.g. python, R)\n\nThere are free learning resources in the “Data Science learning resources” folder within the Data Clinic Teams channel\n\nIntroduce yourself to Ronnie, Siri & Petra from the Audit/QI and Methodology teams\n\nYou will work closely with them throughout the year. It is good to meet up with them so they can show you what they do in the Audit/QI & Methodology clinics and how this relates to the Data Clinic\n\nGet access to the Data Clinic email inbox\n\nEmail Tim Bonnici to obtain\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Progress of Project\n2021/22\n\n\nStart of project\n\nBackground to project including issues we hoped to address laid out in project overview document (see Notion document on Teams channel)\n\nSurvey done on 33 staff members in Critical Care that identified barriers to using data to complete audit/QI projects\n\n7/8 projects served through Data Clinic, including audit/QI/project feasibility projects.\n\nDraft project tracker set up to record length of time taken to serve data for data requests\n\nQualitative feedback on the Data Clinic process gathered from joint meetings between Data lead/Data Fellows/BI team\n\nAdjustments made to running of the Data Clinic from this feedback including identifying the need for Audit/Methodology support for some projects before they attend Data Clinic, to clarify the aims and scope of projects.\n\nOverall, provided qualitative evidence that the Data Clinic initiative was feasible, beneficial to BI team and could help clinical staff.\n\n\n2022/23\n\n\nPlan for the year was to formalise the measurement of the Data Clinic outcomes, with a view to future publication\n\nData Clinic email address and Teams channel set up, to create central repositiory for Data Clinic items. Github set up for code repository.\n\nAudit/QI clinic & Methodology clinic set up. Process of referring projects from these clinics to Data Clinic set up."

This process was often time-consuming and frustrating for both the clinical staff and BI team. \n - Although the BI team have a good understanding of how to find data in Epic and manage it, sometimes they lack the clinical understanding and direction to provide learning from it. \nThe Data Clinic aims to improve the process of providing data to clinical staff using two approaches:\n 1. We aim to understand the clinical question the requestor is trying to answer and, with our knowledge of the data that is available, clarify exactly what data is required for their project.\n 2. Then we work with the BI team to provide that data for the requestor as quickly as possible, in the form that the requestor needs.\nWe hypothesise that this shall benefit both clinical staff and the BI team.\n Clinical staff: \n - makes the process of getting data from EPIC clearer\n - enhances understanding of the data that is available from EPIC \n - help with analysis of data (if required)\n - easier to get the data needed to complete audit/QIP/service evaluations (thereby increasing the number of projects completed and improving patient care)\n\n BI team:\n - Saves time/frustration emailing back-and-forth with clinical staff   \n - Better understanding of clinical relevance of their work (through feedback on the results of QI projects)\n\n\nHow does the Data Clinic work?\nAfter we recieve your request, a member of our team will contact you to arrange a meeting to discuss your project and the data you require (+/- any statistical help required).\nFollowing this meeting, we shall extract a 1st draft of the data with the BI team.\nWe shall then arrange a second meeting with you to show you the data. If you are happy, we shall then extract the full dataset you need. If you are not satisfied, we shall arrange further extractions and meetings until the data fits your requirements.\nThe length of this process can be variable, but we aim to deliver at least the 1st extract of the data within 1 month.\nWe try to be flexible with arranging meetings as we realise you are busy!\n\n\nHow do I access the Data Clinic?\nThere are 2 main ways of contacting the Data Clinic, depending on the nature of your request.\nIf you are doing an Audit/QI project that requires EPIC data, please register your project with the Audit/QI team. A member of the team will then get in contact with you to discuss your project. When the time is right, they will then pass your details on to the Data Clinic, when we shall then get in touch!\nIf your project is not Audit/QI, please email us at: uclh.critical.data@nhs.net\nFor any other questions/requests, please feel free to drop us an email or speak to any of the Data Fellows or Tim Bonicci in person!\n\n\nRelevant contacts\nDr Tim Bonnici: Data Lead for Critical Care (t.bonnici@nhs.net)\nData Fellows: Change yearly, the fellows for 2022/23 are listed below\n\nDr Ruaraidh Campbell (ruaraidh.campbell@nhs.net)\nDr Sarah Vaughan (s.vaughan5@nhs.net)\nDr Hrisheekesh Vaidya (h.vaidya@nhs.net)"
