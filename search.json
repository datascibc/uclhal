    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction The benefits of lung protective ventilation have been replicated in multiple trials.1,2 However, we suspected that adherence to this standard of care remained poor. Using the NIHR critical care Health Informatics Collaborative (ccHIC) database, we analysed data from 11 teaching hospital intensive care units (22-524 patient episodes) to investigate real-world clinical practice.\nMethods 1248 patient episodes, where ventilation was continued for ≥48-hours, with 232,600 hours of concurrent mechanical ventilation and blood gas data were identified as suitable for analysis. Short gaps in ventilation (<6 hours) were imputed based on the median of nearest known values, and only the single longest period of ventilation from each patient episode was analysed.\nResults The median tidal volume received by patients was 7.3 ml/kg-1 PBW (IQR:5.7–8.8). Female patients, especially those with higher BMI (≥30 kgm-2) consistently received higher tidal volumes than males. Patients with severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13kPa) received a median tidal volume of 7.1 ml/kg-1 PBW, and had 71% ICU mortality (Table 1). Patients with respiratory failure sufficient to qualify for recruitment into recent clinical trials (PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa with PEEP ≥5 cm/H20), who were exposed to tidal volumes≥12 ml/kg-1 PBW for longer than two hours had significantly increased risk of ICU mortality (odds ratio=2.89 [1.25–7.2]; p=0.007); This was not observed for patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa (odds ratio=0.95 [0.58–1.56], p=0.91).\nConclusions More than 15 years after the ARMA study1 demonstrated a mortality benefit from lung protective ventilation, we are still not implementing 6 ml/kg-1 PBW ventilation into clinical practice, and are exposing even patients with a severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13 kPa) to higher than recommended tidal volumes, with females and higher BMI patients at particular risk. We have also demonstrated that failure to institute lung protective ventilation in patients with a PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa leads to increased ICU mortality, which is not present in patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAtrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered condition in critical illness and causes adverse effects including haemodynamic decompensation, stroke and prolonged hospital stay. It is a common practice in critical care to supplement serum magnesium for the purpose of preventing episodes of atrial fibrillation. However, no randomised studies support this practice in the non-cardiac surgery critical care population, and the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation is unclear. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in preventing the onset of atrial fibrillation in a mixed critical care population. We conducted a single centre retrospective observational study of adult critical care patients. We utilised a natural experiment design, using the supplementation preference of the bedside critical care nurse as an instrumental variable. Using routinely collected electronic patient data, magnesium supplementation opportunities were defined and linked to the bedside nurse. Nurse preference for administering magnesium was obtained using multilevel modelling. The results were used to define “liberal” and “restrictive” supplementation groups, which were inputted into an instrumental variable regression to obtain an estimate of the effect of magnesium supplementation. 9114 magnesium supplementation opportunities were analysed, representing 2137 critical care admissions for 1914 patients. There was significant variation in magnesium supplementation practices attributable to the individual nurse, after accounting for covariates. The instrumental variable analysis showed magnesium supplementation was associated with a 3% decreased relative risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation event (95% CI −0.06 to −0.004, p=0.03). This study supports the strategy of routine supplementation, but further work is required to identify optimal serum magnesium targets for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis."

A multidisciplinary team from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) spent two years developing the Experimental Medicine Application Platform (EMAP) platform to make fuller, faster, more effective use of data in electronic health records (EHRs).\nThe COVID pandemic saw them demonstrate the quality of the platform and the team. Using the EMAP infrastructure they rapidly created a bed management tool that helped take pressure off north London intensive care units (ICUs). Now the team has facilitated a series of grants to take their work into new areas including better antibiotic stewardship."
