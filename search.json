    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving and maintaining normal sub-lingual blood flow in small ( 20um) vessels, termed as microcirculation, is essential for critically ill intensive care patients since this is where the delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues occurs. However, historically, most clinical trials & treatments have focused on blood flow in the larger blood vessels (macrocirculation), largely due to the greater ease with which this can be practically measured. Technological advances have enabled video recordings of the sub-lingual microcirculation (i.e. from under the tongue) to be obtained using darkfield microscopy (DFM). However, the difficulties in analysing these videos has hindered the uptake and utilisation of this imaging modality. Currently, these short video sequences are analysed mostly by hand, to quantify the vessel density and flow within vessels within the field of view. The manual analysis and vessel segmentation is an extremely labour intensive procedure, which can take up to one hour to score a single video [12].\nThis challenge aimed to establish whether a single validated measure of microcirculatory perfusion (microcirculatory flow index) can be predicted directly from a DFM video sequence, without intermediate manual analysis steps. Automatic analysis that can be carried out in (near) real-time would facilitate the incorporation of microcirulatory targets into clinical trials by enabling the impact of interventions to be quantified and enacted upon with the aim of optimising the microcirculation and improving patient outcomes."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction The benefits of lung protective ventilation have been replicated in multiple trials.1,2 However, we suspected that adherence to this standard of care remained poor. Using the NIHR critical care Health Informatics Collaborative (ccHIC) database, we analysed data from 11 teaching hospital intensive care units (22-524 patient episodes) to investigate real-world clinical practice.\nMethods 1248 patient episodes, where ventilation was continued for ≥48-hours, with 232,600 hours of concurrent mechanical ventilation and blood gas data were identified as suitable for analysis. Short gaps in ventilation (<6 hours) were imputed based on the median of nearest known values, and only the single longest period of ventilation from each patient episode was analysed.\nResults The median tidal volume received by patients was 7.3 ml/kg-1 PBW (IQR:5.7–8.8). Female patients, especially those with higher BMI (≥30 kgm-2) consistently received higher tidal volumes than males. Patients with severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13kPa) received a median tidal volume of 7.1 ml/kg-1 PBW, and had 71% ICU mortality (Table 1). Patients with respiratory failure sufficient to qualify for recruitment into recent clinical trials (PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa with PEEP ≥5 cm/H20), who were exposed to tidal volumes≥12 ml/kg-1 PBW for longer than two hours had significantly increased risk of ICU mortality (odds ratio=2.89 [1.25–7.2]; p=0.007); This was not observed for patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa (odds ratio=0.95 [0.58–1.56], p=0.91).\nConclusions More than 15 years after the ARMA study1 demonstrated a mortality benefit from lung protective ventilation, we are still not implementing 6 ml/kg-1 PBW ventilation into clinical practice, and are exposing even patients with a severe respiratory failure (PaO2:FiO2 <13 kPa) to higher than recommended tidal volumes, with females and higher BMI patients at particular risk. We have also demonstrated that failure to institute lung protective ventilation in patients with a PaO2:FiO2 <20 kPa leads to increased ICU mortality, which is not present in patients with PaO2:FiO2 ≥40 kPa."

This study describes ethnicity data in nation-wide electronic health records in England, UK.\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified person-level records for the England population available in the National Health Service (NHS) Digital trusted research environment. Primary care records (GDPPR) were linked to hospital and national mortality records. We assessed completeness, consistency, and granularity of ethnicity records using all available SNOMED-CT concepts for ethnicity and NHS ethnicity categories.\nFindings\nFrom 61.8 million individuals registered with a primary care practice in England, 51.5 (83.3%) had at least one ethnicity record in GDPPR, increasing to 93·9% when linked with hospital records. Approximately 12·0% had at least two conflicting ethnicity codes in primary care records. Women were more likely to have ethnicity recorded than men. Ethnicity was missing most frequently in individuals from 18 to 39 years old and in the southern regions of England. Individuals with an ethnicity record had more comorbidities recorded than those without. Of 489 SNOMED-CT ethnicity concepts available, 255 were used in primary care records. Discrepancies between SNOMED-CT and NHS ethnicity categories were observed, specifically within “Other-” ethnicity groups.\nInterpretation\nMore than 250 ethnicity sub-groups may be found in health records for the English population, although commonly categorised into “White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Mixed”, and “Other”. One in ten individuals do not have ethnicity information recorded in primary care or hospital records. SNOMED-CT codes represent more diversity in ethnicity groups than the NHS ethnicity classification. Improved recording of self-reported ethnicity at first point-of-care and consistency in ethnicity classification across healthcare settings can potentially improve the accuracy of ethnicity in research and ultimately care for all ethnicities.\nFunding\nBritish Heart Foundation Data Science Centre led by Health Data Research UK."

We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence.\nParticipants\nAll 12–17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between 1 July 2020 and 31 March 2021 using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre.\nMain outcome measures\nHospitalisations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12–17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence.\nResults\nAt high future case incidence of 1000/100,000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100,000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and two deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100,000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date.\nConclusions\nGiven the current (as at 15 September 2021) high case rates (680/100,000 population/week in 10–19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAtrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered condition in critical illness and causes adverse effects including haemodynamic decompensation, stroke and prolonged hospital stay. It is a common practice in critical care to supplement serum magnesium for the purpose of preventing episodes of atrial fibrillation. However, no randomised studies support this practice in the non-cardiac surgery critical care population, and the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation is unclear. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in preventing the onset of atrial fibrillation in a mixed critical care population. We conducted a single centre retrospective observational study of adult critical care patients. We utilised a natural experiment design, using the supplementation preference of the bedside critical care nurse as an instrumental variable. Using routinely collected electronic patient data, magnesium supplementation opportunities were defined and linked to the bedside nurse. Nurse preference for administering magnesium was obtained using multilevel modelling. The results were used to define “liberal” and “restrictive” supplementation groups, which were inputted into an instrumental variable regression to obtain an estimate of the effect of magnesium supplementation. 9114 magnesium supplementation opportunities were analysed, representing 2137 critical care admissions for 1914 patients. There was significant variation in magnesium supplementation practices attributable to the individual nurse, after accounting for covariates. The instrumental variable analysis showed magnesium supplementation was associated with a 3% decreased relative risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation event (95% CI −0.06 to −0.004, p=0.03). This study supports the strategy of routine supplementation, but further work is required to identify optimal serum magnesium targets for atrial fibrillation prophylaxis."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nUpdatable estimates of COVID-19 onset, progression, and trajectories underpin pandemic mitigation efforts. To identify and characterise disease trajectories, we aimed to define and validate ten COVID-19 phenotypes from nationwide linked electronic health records (EHR) using an extensible framework.\nMethods\nIn this cohort study, we used eight linked National Health Service (NHS) datasets for people in England alive on Jan 23, 2020. Data on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, primary and secondary care records, and death registrations were collected until Nov 30, 2021. We defined ten COVID-19 phenotypes reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity and encompassing five categories: positive SARS-CoV-2 test, primary care diagnosis, hospital admission, ventilation modality (four phenotypes), and death (three phenotypes). We constructed patient trajectories illustrating transition frequency and duration between phenotypes. Analyses were stratified by pandemic waves and vaccination status. Findings\nAmong 57 032 174 individuals included in the cohort, 13 990 423 COVID-19 events were identified in 7 244 925 individuals, equating to an infection rate of 12·7% during the study period. Of 7 244 925 individuals, 460 737 (6·4%) were admitted to hospital and 158 020 (2·2%) died. Of 460 737 individuals who were admitted to hospital, 48 847 (10·6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 69 090 (15·0%) received non-invasive ventilation, and 25 928 (5·6%) received invasive ventilation. Among 384 135 patients who were admitted to hospital but did not require ventilation, mortality was higher in wave 1 (23 485 [30·4%] of 77 202 patients) than wave 2 (44 220 [23·1%] of 191 528 patients), but remained unchanged for patients admitted to the ICU. Mortality was highest among patients who received ventilatory support outside of the ICU in wave 1 (2569 [50·7%] of 5063 patients). 15 486 (9·8%) of 158 020 COVID-19-related deaths occurred within 28 days of the first COVID-19 event without a COVID-19 diagnoses on the death certificate. 10 884 (6·9%) of 158 020 deaths were identified exclusively from mortality data with no previous COVID-19 phenotype recorded. We observed longer patient trajectories in wave 2 than wave 1. Interpretation\nOur analyses illustrate the wide spectrum of disease trajectories as shown by differences in incidence, survival, and clinical pathways. We have provided a modular analytical framework that can be used to monitor the impact of the pandemic and generate evidence of clinical and policy relevance using multiple EHR sources.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground:\nInfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a prothrombotic state, but long-term effects of COVID-19 on incidence of vascular diseases are unclear.\nMethods:\nWe studied vascular diseases after COVID-19 diagnosis in population-wide anonymized linked English and Welsh electronic health records from January 1 to December 7, 2020. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing the incidence of arterial thromboses and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence in people without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted subgroup analyses by COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and previous history.\nResults:\nAmong 48 million adults, 125 985 were hospitalized and 1 319 789 were not hospitalized within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. In England, there were 260 279 first arterial thromboses and 59 421 first VTEs during 41.6 million person-years of follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios for first arterial thrombosis after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with no COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 21.7 (95% CI, 21.0–22.4) in week 1 after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1.34 (95% CI, 1.21–1.48) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios for first VTE after COVID-19 diagnosis declined from 33.2 (95% CI, 31.3–35.2) in week 1 to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.50–2.17) during weeks 27 to 49. Adjusted hazard ratios were higher, for longer after diagnosis, after hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, among Black or Asian versus White people, and among people without versus with a previous event. The estimated whole-population increases in risk of arterial thromboses and VTEs 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, corresponding to 7200 and 3500 additional events, respectively, after 1.4 million COVID-19 diagnoses.\nConclusions:\nHigh relative incidence of vascular events soon after COVID-19 diagnosis declines more rapidly for arterial thromboses than VTEs. However, incidence remains elevated up to 49 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. These results support policies to prevent severe COVID-19 by means of COVID-19 vaccines, early review after discharge, risk factor control, and use of secondary preventive agents in high-risk patients."

    "text": "Getting data in near real time offers profound benefits for everything from clinical decisions about individual patients to resource management across entire hospitals. A multidisciplinary team from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) spent two years developing the Experimental Medicine Application Platform (EMAP) platform to make fuller, faster, more effective use of data in electronic health records (EHRs).\nThe COVID pandemic saw them demonstrate the quality of the platform and the team. Using the EMAP infrastructure they rapidly created a bed management tool that helped take pressure off north London intensive care units (ICUs). Now the team has facilitated a series of grants to take their work into new areas including better antibiotic stewardship."

This allowed staff to be allocated where they were most needed and kept transfer beds available at all times. The tool supported the treatment of 434 critically ill patients (including retrieving 162 patients to the UCHL surge centre) from overstretched units across north London."
