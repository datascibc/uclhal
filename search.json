This means that we don’t rely on just the ‘safety’ of the data but also take into account the following:\n\n\n\nall individuals have substantive contracts or educational relationships with higher education or NHS institutions\nthose working need to have evidence of experience of working with such data (e.g. previous training, previous work with ONS, data safe havens etc.) or they need a supervisor who can has similar experience\nthose working need to undergo training in information governance and issues with statistical disclosure control (SDC)\n\n\n\n\n\nprojects must ‘serve the public good’\nprojects must meet relevant HRA and UCLH research and ethics approvals\nservice delivery work mandated as per usual trust processes\n\n\n\n\n\nworking at UCLH in the NHS on approved infrastructure\nUCLH local and remote desktops\nUCLH Data Science Desktop\nGeneric Application Development Environment (GADE)\n\n\n\n\n\noutputs (e.g. reports, figures and tables) must be non-disclosing\noutputs should remain on NHS systems initially\na copy of all outputs that are released externally (documents) should be stored in one central location so that there is visibility for all\n\n\n\n\n\ndirect identifiers (hospital numbers, NHS numbers, names etc) should be masked unless there is an explicit justification for their use\ndata releases are proportionate (e.g. limited by calendar periods, by patient cohort etc.)\nfurther work to obscure or mask the data is not necessary given the other safe guards (as per the recommendation by the UK data service)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of this content is derived and adapted from the Safe Data Access Professional’s Working group, and we strongly recommend reviewing their handbook]\n\n\n\n\n\nPractically although this means that we are judging your data safety on more than just the qualities of the data, we are able to work with data that would otherwise be considered unsafe. The plot below demonstrates this by comparing the effort we would have to expend on safety if we wanted to release data on the internet. This means that we lose all the other 4 safes.\n\n\n\nSafety through disclosure control alone is much harder than using the other 4 ‘safes’"

A multidisciplinary team from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) spent two years developing the Experimental Medicine Application Platform (EMAP) platform to make fuller, faster, more effective use of data in electronic health records (EHRs).\nThe COVID pandemic saw them demonstrate the quality of the platform and the team. Using the EMAP infrastructure they rapidly created a bed management tool that helped take pressure off north London intensive care units (ICUs). Now the team has facilitated a series of grants to take their work into new areas including better antibiotic stewardship."

The tool supported the treatment of 434 critically ill patients (including retrieving 162 patients to the UCHL surge centre) from overstretched units across north London."
