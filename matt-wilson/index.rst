Variation in how clinicians apply treatments and interventions is a widespread phenomenon across all facets of health services.  It arises due to the lack of robust evidence to guide clinical decision making, and from individual assessment of the relevance of evidence to each unique scenario.

Variation in practice may generate improved outcomes for individual patients.  Equally, it may result in adverse outcomes, or make no difference.  Currently, healthcare systems use audit cycles to identify variance from clinical guidelines, where variance is interpreted negatively â€“ an approach which lacks nuance.

Clinicians currently lack a robust system for capturing and learning from clinical decision making.  The introduction of Electronic Health Record Systems has allowed the observation of clinical decisions using routinely collected patient data.  However, there exists no reliable mechanism to allow clinicians to express their uncertainty pertaining to a given treatment question, in a manner which facilitates learning.  

Learning Health Systems offer a framework for the efficient generation of new knowledge using routinely collected electronic data.  These systems are in their infancy and substantial barriers to their implementation exist.  This thesis will explore whether variation in clinical decision making may be a suitable lever for researchers to harness using Learning Health System tools, to generate reliable evidence for optimal treatment decisions to help clinicians in the care of future patients.
